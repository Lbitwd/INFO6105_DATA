The accounts you sent back verified are entirely inaccurate, fraudulent incomplete and represents a very serious error in your reporting. Also, be advised that this is my second time contacting you company about this matter in writing. Your company is in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681. No need for me to go into detail and tell you the law.

I AM A VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT. MY INFORMATION WAS LEAKED IN A RECENT DATA BREACH WITH XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I AM ALLOWING 3 BUSINESS DAYS ALONE FOR THIS MATTER TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD OF AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. 
As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. That basically means that you cant just verify my account by telling me it is verified. Nor can you verify my account by telling me you contacted the creditor and the account I disputed is Verified. This means that IF you cant send me proof of these accounts from YOUR COMPANY, it must come off immediately.

All in all, you have ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify the disputed accounts which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify any of these accounts and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly delete all information which can not be verified.

You failed to verify and validate all data for this account, every notation, dates and balances. This account needs to be removed IMMEDIATELY via FCRA section 609.

If your company, XXXX, fails to comply with federal regulations by credit reporting agencies, you will be required to appear in a court venue local to me, in order to formally defend yourself. I will also have your company investigated by the Federal Trade Commission ( see 15 USC 41, et seq. ). I am also maintaining a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC and the Attorney Generals office, should you continue in your non-compliance. I further remind you that, as in Wenger v. Trans Union Corp., No. 95-6445 ( C.D.Cal. Nov. 14, 1995 ), you may be liable for your willful non- compliance.

Failure to respond satisfactorily within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter will result in a small claims action against your company. I will be seeking {$5000.00} in damages for : 1. ) Defamation 2. ) Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud 3. ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Also, I would like an updated copy of my credit report once this investigation is complete.

( XXXX ) In response to notices received from RTR dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we are requesting that these omissions of RTR having received either Notice of Assignment, Sale or Transfer of servicing rights of the loan to be definitely defined per statutes of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), the Fair Debt collections Act ( FDCPA ), as well as the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) .RTR was served with a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they have failed to properly respond to our demands under RESPA , FDCPA and FCRA. They have failed to indicate and establish proper ownership and rights to service the loan. Furthermore, they have failed to provide an itemized accounting ledger of crediting payments made, late fees, etc. from multiple alleged prior servicers of the loan. The assignments, sale affidavits, allonge ( s ) to the note and loan transfers documentation is incomplete and inconsistent with proper mortgage securities and we feel that we are victims of mortgage securitization fraud on many levels, riddled with an array of abusive deceptive practices and misrepresentation.XXXX of RTR, signed an alleged executed agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) dated XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. By RTR 's own omissions they did not take over servicing rights to the loan until XXXX XXXX, XXXX from XXXX. We have also taken this matter a step further and contacted XXXX County land records here in Texas, and there is no record of assignments for this loan which support or remotely indicate that RTR nor XXXX carry legitimate custodial servicing rights or ownership to this loan. In fact, it appears as though XXXX, still owns the loan which is impossible, because they filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX and all securities liquidated. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" A '' -Collection Agreement Forgery ) According to land records, the loan was originated with XXXX . From there, it was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down, following XXXX XXXX filing bankruptcy XXXX XXXX, XXXX. So how is it possible that there was any such agreement made with XXXX and RTR? The answer is. it 's not possible.It appears that the agent of RTR, named XXXX XXXX, is in fact a Robo-signer ; since the alleged agreement according to RTR was signed and dated XXXX, XXXX XXXX ; long after the collapse of XXXX. The milestones report that was provided from RTR is dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The report documents a span from XXXX XXXX, XXXX until XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; indicating custodial service rights transfers for XXXX, XXXX, and even XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) .The problem as previously addressed, is that XXXX dissolved in XXXX, XXXX XXXX Chapter XXXX in XXXX, all securities sold off, and XXXX is prohibited from participating in any consumer loan in the capacity of owner servicer or any such activities as of XXXX. As far as we are able to tell, the milestone report has been falsified. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" B '' -- XXXX XXXX ) RTR, has also failed to provide evidence of documentation detailing updated assignments of ownership or necessary proof of their custodial servicing obligations. Furthermore, per RESPA and the FDCPA surrounding mortgage debt validation, we are demanding a complete chain of title as well as the Allonge to the Note, sale affidavits and evidence transfer from XXXX to XXXX and XXXX to XXXX, and finally XXXX to RTR.

On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted - after agreeing to use XXXX 's affiliate for Title work - by XXXX. On the "" message board '' I had a preliminary closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. It appeared that the wheels were in motion. However, the underwriters began to ask for additional financial information - anything that I sent was not good enough - for example- "" could not use bank statement because the banks name was not on every page ''. I had to have my husband write a letter stating I had access to all funds in our JOINT account and sign it. ( do they not understand the meaning of a JOINT account?? ) After submission they came back and said could not accept b/c wrong account # 's. After correcting and having him initial - they came back saying could not accept b/c all parties had not initialed the correction. ( why am I initialing on a letter he wrote and signed allowing me use of the funds in our joint account? ) This continued with everything that was submitted. At this point we are about 2 weeks out from closing date. I am contacted by someone on the message board requesting additional information on my retirement fund. On the message board the underwriters were requesting the terms of the plan, not just a statement but the actual terms of my employer 's plan. We had a gifted amount from someone, we had signed gift letter as requested early in the process, stating we did not have to pay this back to the donor. The underwriters continued to request copies of the donors bank statement, withdrawal receipt, deposit slip, etc. Explaining that the donor 's bank statement had not cut yet we provided copy of checks from his bank showing it had passed through his bank as well as ours. The gentlemen I am now dealing with is in a "" Solutions '' area and I am no longer working with the Senior Processor. This was not explained to me until I made multiple phone calls to all parties involved that I am extremely frustrated at this point, nearly a week away from the closing date they still show on the message board, and I have underwriters continuing to drill and drill requesting more and more, for example - had to provide copy of rent payment every month for the past 24 months. ( this is a week from closing ) I had provided everything they had requested. The gentleman in the "" Solutions '' area then comes back stating that the checks the donor provided have the word Loan in the memo ... The underwriters are now requesting a written explanation from the donor ( who out of the kindness of his heart gave us this money ) explaining why he wrote that on the check. Extremely over the process at this point and now having to go back to this person for a 4th time. The donor, for us, writes the letter and signs. I went back and forth with the Solutions person stating I was ready to walk away and really did not want to request this from the donor. I was told "" underwriting won't allow the use of the gifted assets without that letter '' explaining why he wrote loan on the memo. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. The letter was provided the same day. I understand FHA guidelines not allowing it to be a repay situation but at this point you have gone above and beyond with a gift letter stating funds do not have to be paid back and the letter of explanation also stating the funds do not have to be paid back. On XX/XX/XXXX - 2 days before STILL scheduled closing date of XX/XX/XXXX - I am told that the underwriters will not allow us to use the gifted funds as the checks have the word loan written on them. 
We provided exactly what they asked, and they come back 2 days prior to closing to say we can't use, so we had to withdraw. Nearly 3 months of many phone calls, many emails, and scrambling around to meet the requirements of ridiculous requests from the underwriters, to be told 2 days before closing the deal is off. Title work was supposed to be in place, insurance was in place ( luckily I had put them on hold ), notice given to where I currently am leasing and have to be out of by the XXXX of this month.. .and I have twin boys turning 6 on the XXXX who I had to tell we were not moving. Now I have no place to go. 
I feel I was extremely targeted here, perhaps b/c I was a woman going through the process on my own and don't have the best credit or high income. I do not know, but I know I was put through by the underwriters as what I would describe as unjust harassment.",,"Rocket Mortgage, LLC",VA,24572.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3294085

173,2019-08-18,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Dear CFPB :

Please find this Amended Complaint; Qualified Written Request; Validation of Debt; and Request for Adequate Assurance from Bank of America  (“BOA”) and XXXX XXXX, Inc. (XXXX XXXX”) aka XXXX  XXXX XXXX   (“XXXX”) for their mortgage fraud; fraud with XXXX XXXX securities; forgery; unlawful collection  and violations of all possible laws. 

While BOA’s sham conduit XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX  (“XXXX”) who pretend to be “owner/investor” (now merely “servicer”) repeatedly stated that I have right to dispute my debt, at the same time they deprived me from  this right  and now illegally  try to accelerate my payments by threats  with a foreclosure – without proper validation or any Assurances, solely based on a poorly forged by XXXX XXXX Allonge to the Note (without any endorsements) where XXXX is not even mentioned. BOA relentless fraud, extortion  and scary tactic placed me under extreme emotional distress which caused severe damages to my health condition since I have to take strong pain killers and sleep medication because I lost my night sleep dealing with BOA and their co-conspirators criminal conduct and violations of all laws.  

I received additional evidence from  XXXX which  clearly indicates that neither XXXX or XXXX are not the real party who actually own my debt but rather fake conduits for Bank of America who illegally cashing my mortgage payment checks without guaranteeing that upon completion of my loan I will successfully own my title. This evidence also shows that my “lender” is simply a front for BoA whose ultimate goal with my loan is to push me into foreclosure through murky collection practices and fees while the bank enriches itself through reselling my loan through securities known as CDO (derivatives). 

This evidence further shows that my performing loan was internally defaulted by BOA to illegally remove it from XXXX  XXXX custody by abusing a XXXX XXXX rule that give issuers the option to buy back their loans if the loans are 90 days delinquent or more; and resell for profits . 

Both XXXX  and XXXX  merely  impersonate as ""servicer"" and ""owners/investors"" to defraud me about the real identity of the party – BOA - who collects my mortgage payments as their handsome income  while they want me to think I repay the debt to legitimate investors; as well as about the real party who sends me threatening Notices – XXXX  XXXX. 

My conclusion is based on  XXXX  respond  on XX/XX/XXXX where they sent me a copy of poorly forged Alonge to the Note which lacked any chain of Assignments in violation of all applicable laws; and threatened me with a Payoff demand – while I never refused to pay my mortgage to the  lawful owners of my debt as soon as the debt is validated. 

Plus, it appears that onXX/XX/XXXX XXXX   promptly changed its payment mailing address from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  TX to XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX   CA, so I don’t even know where my mortgage payments should be mailed and who actually collected them in XXXX, TX where neither XXXX or XXXX  have no officers nearby. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed  a Complaint to Michigan Senator XXXX  asking for help and intervention. I included in this email Bank of America’s top executives. 

The very same day,XX/XX/XXXX XXXX,  who during last three months  was not able to located any documents related to my loan,  suddenly ""found"" the whole closing package (!) which was emailed to them by someone else ( XXXX  XXXX) via large PDF file. 

You can see from the attached documents, the top and the bottom of each page has a line ""Generated by XXXX XXXX"" (on top); and ""click here to unlock XXXX"" (on the bottom). This PDF file was sent by someone, aka XXXX  XXXX, owned by Mr. XXXX, XXXX, who also owns XXXX. While one part of Mr. XXXX business – XXXX XXXX fka XXXX XXXX XXXX /XXXX – operates a sophisticated forgery mill of  mortgage Notes to defraud borrowers and investors; another part – XXXX   XXXX  – issues property Title insurances for fatally damaged by  XXXX XXXX Titles

XXXX  mailed this  package to me by overnight XXXX   about XXXX XXXX the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, apparently without even reviewing included  documents. Bear to repeat, I requested these documents since XXXX   XXXX  and XXXX  was not able to locate it until I included Senator XXXX  into this dispute.  Otherwise they would notice that the Note is not endorsed at all; and the Allonge is very poorly forged by someone who has NO authority to sign Notes or transfer them. 

XXXX   merely  separated XXXXt file in two parts and put one part on front of their package - such as a  copy of my Note without ANY endorsements and a copy of a very poorly forged Allonge  prepared by XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX  who on XX/XX/XXXX (!) the same day as my loan was signed, passed it to XXXX XXXX XXXX   while XXXX claimed that they received it on XX/XX/XXXX. It was unclear if Mr. XXXX  worked for XXXX or XXXX   at the time when he signed Allonge  to this Note which Mr. XXXX  had no authority to sign under ANY circumstances. 

This is a glaring violation of all endorsement rules, plus Collateral Shipper XXXX  (who worked for whom?) had NO authority to sign anything to XXXX, he merely must obtain an authorized signature. XXXX XXXX or any Trust was not mentioned at all, as well as Mortgagee XXXX or “owner/investor” XXXX  (who is a FAKE Servicer) . 

I suspect that this Allonge was  prepared on a  rush basis on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX by  – Mr. XXXX - who had no idea about anything regarding my loan -  when XXXX   received it (XX/XX/XXXX); XXXX as a mortgage, ect. Someone (aka XXXX  XXXX) merely had someone (posing  as XXXX XXXX)  to sign an obviously fraudulent document. 

Mr. XXXX signature is not a wet ink signature and appears to be an electronically forged signature which can be placed by anybody – thus, a modernized variation of robo-signing. 

In the middle of the document pile XXXX  put billing documents received probably from XXXX. The don't have PDF file on the bottom and top (see XXXX  Sequence of documents)

 At the end XXXXc  attached  all documents related to origination, including Appraisal, photos, ect. Total over 100 pages (speaking about ""broad and burdensome"" request to give me a name of the Trust and proof of the valid Transfer with  value paid). Obviously, XXXX  wanted to make an impression that all these documents were originally in their files and kept in  consecutive chronological order while they were obviously not. 

 Again, the front  and back parts of these documents were the same voluminous PDF file received by XXXX  via email from XXXX  XXXX  for the first time on XX/XX/XXXX while documents in the middle came from some other sources. 

None of these documents mentioned  XXXX as an ""owner/investor"" (now XXXX claims to be merely ""servicers"" while Servicers are NOT owners of the loans, thus XXXX made false statements to mislead me about their “ownership” ).

Here is  no proof of any valid transfer or any value paid by XXXX to XXXX or by XXXX to XXXX from whom XXXX received my loan from XXXX via  Allonge transfer on XX/XX/XXXX while XXXX insisted that they obtained my loan from XXXX onXX/XX/XXXX.  According to endorcement rules,  must use the NOTE space first before they attach any allonges. 

According to the Rules: The note must be endorsed to each subsequent owner of the mortgage unless one or more of the owners endorsed the note in blank. The last endorsement on the note should be that of the mortgage seller. The mortgage seller must endorse the note in blank and without recourse. 

The only endorsement on the Allonge is “Pay to XXXX   XXXX  XXXX, Inc without recourse” was made on XX/XX/XXXX while XXXX claimed they are next servicers who receive my loan onXX/XX/XXXX for servicing purposes and owner/investor is XXXX  XXXX. No other endorsements are  present – neither to XXXX  XXXX   although they must be listed on the Note; nor to XXXX. 

The Rules also specify using an Allonge for the Endorsement.   The endorsement must appear on the note. An allonge  may be used for the endorsement as long as the following requirements are met: The form and content of the allonge used must comply with all applicable state, local, or federal law governing the use of allonges and result in an enforceable and proper endorsement to the note.  The allonge must be permanently affixed to the related note and must clearly identify the note by referencing at least the name of the borrower(s), the date of the note, the amount of the note, and the address of the security property.  The note must clearly reference the attached allonge. XXXX XXXX status as a “holder in due course” must not be impaired. 

Once again, here is NOTHING on the Note referencing to XXXX  XXXX; or XXXX or Allonge itself which was prepared by collateral shipper Mr. XXXX  who does not have authority to assign any Notes. 

In other words, my Note and Allonge are a glaring example of modern documents forgery committed by the same companies who flooded US Courts with forged robo-signed foreclosures. These companies changed their names to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX but their criminal practices are the same. 

Bear to repeat, after I asked why both servicers  - XXXX   and XXXX receive my payments in the same post Office in XXXX TX, XXXX  promptly changed payment mailing address from XXXX XXXX  in XXXX TX to XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  XXXX  CA .

 So, where I should pay my mortgage? Why XXXX   demanded my XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments to be mailed to XXXX TX if they don’t even have offices in TX? Whom I paid my debt when I mailed my payments to XXXX  TX?  

When I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX how they  deposited   my payments (this conversation was  witnessed by XXXX banker XXXX   XXXX  who processed my check  to XXXX), XXXX   representative Mr. XXXX said that XXXX deposited it in THEIR account with Bank of America. 

According to the refund check XXXX  mailed me on XX/XX/XXXX from their Oklahoma XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, OK XX/XX/XXXX, this BOA location is in Georgia and routing number is XX/XX/XXXX. It does not make any sense for XX/XX/XXXXwhose place of business is in Oklahoma, to collect my payments in XX/XX/XXXX TX and issue me refunds from BOA account located in XX/XX/XXXX GA while process my payments with a different BOA location. If XX/XX/XXXX used BOA location in GA, it would be reasonable to deposit my payments on the same account. 

Based on XXXX XXXX  MBS Guide, my payments should be handled by a Trustee (apparently XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX) and distributed to XXXX XXXX investors. None of it present.

But my payments were processed by BOA in TX (where neither XXXX or XXXX  do not have any offices nearby) and Bank of Final Deposit had routing number XXXX, which belonged to XXXX XXXX XXXX   which merged with BOA

The name of the Trust is not mentioned but the XXXX XXXX pool is supposedly XXXX. XXXX XXXX pools have different abbreviations; and I was not able to locate any XXXX Trusts.

Now XXXX  said that they prepared a PayOff Demand letter, apparently trying to demand me to pay them FULL amount of my loan, in violation of all applicable laws, while I never refused to pay my debt and lawfully requested Validation of Debt and Adequate Assurance during which time I have right to suspend my performance.

XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the first time provided me a copy of my Note – without ANY assignments; and poorly forged Allonge to the Note while the Note has no references to any Allonges or XXXX what-so-ever; and now XXXXXXXX wants me to pay them the ENTIRE amount of my loan, which is a text book fraud; wrongful collection; violation of FDCPA and racket under RICO Act.

So, the delay with payment was caused not by my refusal to pay ( I am willing and able my debt to legitimate investors) but by XXXX  violation of all applicable laws.

I really don't know that to do about since these criminals have no limits in their violations of the law and I am consented they can illegally foreclose even though I have all evidence of their fraud and they cannot accelerate payments during validation period. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX (who emailed XXXX  PDF file on XX/XX/XXXX)  Here is that they said: “Ms. XXXX, Thank you for your correspondence.  This matter does not involve XXXX   XXXX business activities and any questions that you may have should be directed to the current servicer of your loan. Sincerely”

This is a blatant lie. First, XXXX XXXX ordered a copy of the FEMA map acting on behalf of XXXX as their client. 

Second, anyone who knows about securitization of residential debt knows that the only way the banks could succeed is if they had a central repository and central command center from which all documents were fabricated and all instructions were issued. 
For nearly all loans the central command was XXXX, aided by XXXX. 

While XXXX is technically defunct and XXXX XXXX went to jail taking one for the team, the functions of XXXX  remained the same.

XXXX  changed its name to XXXX  XXXX  who in fact is owned and operated by XXXX   and Me. XXXX XXXX, and in a PR coup transformed itself into the publisher of what is largely viewed as comprehensive data on mortgage lending and foreclosures. Hence it went from the purveyor of false, fraudulent, forged documentation to the purveyor of data perceived as reliable and thence became a trusted source whose data is considered worthy of legal presumptions.

Systems at XXXX/XXXX XXXX  include data processing on virtually all residential loans subject to claims of securitization many of which are represented by data on the XX/XX/XXXX  Platform which is a workaround to hide separate split transfers of the debt, the note and the mortgage or deed of trust. The systems on XXXX/XXXX   XXXX are designed for the express purpose of presenting consistent data in foreclosure claims. As such it also enables the rotation of apparent servicers, none of whom perform bookkeeping functions even if some of them interact with borrowers as if they were actually the servicers.

The rotation of servicers comes with the false representation and illusion of boarding in which the process is falsely represented as meaning that the new servicer inspected, audited, reviewed and input the data into their own system. None of that occurred. Instead the new servicer merely gained access to the same XXXX   system as the last servicer with a new login and password.

All evidence shows that the functions for fabricated, forging and robosigning documents continue to be performed under the direction of XXXX/XXXX XXXX (in fact, by XXXX under leadership of XXXX XXXX XXXX) ) which receives all instructions from various investment banks who have each started their own securitization scheme masking apparent trades in the secondary market for loans and trades in the shadow banking market where “private contracts” are regularly traded without any securities regulation.

 Far from dropping their connection with XXXX/XXXX the major banks have completely embraced this central repository of all loan data, all of which is subject to manual and algorithmic manipulation to suit the needs of the banks; thus they produce a report that creates the illusion of credibility, reliability and even independence even though none of those things are true.  This is why the claims of a “Boarding process” are pure fiction, because the records are always kept in the same place and never move. 

This is obvious in my situation with fake Servicers XXXX   and XXXX  who have no documents pertaining to my loan. 

XXXX was the place where most of not all document fabrications took place including signatures that were forged or robosigned. Fabrication means that they were creating documents that did not previously exist. Those documents did not exist for only one reason, to wit: there was no transaction to document so the document was never prepared until it was necessary to fake it for the purposes of foreclosures.

XXXX XXXX  is now used as a trusted source of information about mortgages and foreclosures despite being the central entity (operating through third party contractors) from which false documents are created and used in foreclosures.

It was necessary to fake it because under the law, it isn’t enough to allege or assert that a borrower failed to pay. Failure to pay is only a breach as to the owner of the debt who is entitled to receive the payment because he/she/it paid money for the debt and the rights to enforce. But no such payment ever occurred. If there is no rebach there is no claim.

So in order to cover-up the illusions created by fabrications of documents, it was necessary to fake the sending, filing and serving of process of documents. The secrecy  was accomplished by sending the notices not from the central repository, XXXX XXXX, which would make it obvious that it was all coming from one place, but from different locations around the country — hundreds of them.

So in my  example, XXXX agrees to let XXXX XXXX   use its name for notices, and Bank of America agrees to have the notice sent from one of its thousands of locations. In reality the notice came from XXXX XXXX (aka XXXX).

Again, it is very evident in my loan where XXXX  XXXX   was secretly  involved from the beginning when XXXX   XXXX ordered a Flood Insurance Map from FEMA acting on behalf of their “client” XXXX, the purported “Lender”. 

 The  massive PDF file to XXXX was emailed on XX/XX/XXXX  by XXXX  XXXX  who did not even bother to prepare somehow legitimately-looking assignment or  include XXXX into it. Thus, Mr. XXXX   XXXX, who forged an Allonge, shall be held for document forgery and fraud against Federal Government from who Mr. XXXX  STOLE my loan and the Note which he “assigned” to XXXX, not XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX  evasive and incomplete responses regarding essential documents related to my debt – a copy of my Note with full chain of transfer and a receipt of sale/purchase,  leaves only one possible conclusion, to wit: that the loan origination was only one part of a much larger undisclosed scheme, the existence of which was intentionally obscured and withheld from the borrower, whose name, signature reputation and home were not just material, but absolutely essential requirements for the success of the scheme, which includes huge  tax evasion and money laundering. 

The intent was clearly not to receive repayment of a loan. In fact all evidence currently available suggests that any money that has been received as a result of the “loans” to consumers was actually revenue disguised as principal, interest, or the proceeds of property sales – voluntary or involuntary. 

The current evidence strongly suggests that there was a complete conversion of the loan receivable from the category of “asset” to “income.” In order to maintain the illusion, which required concealment of the conversion of the apparent loan receivable from asset to income, it was necessary to bring foreclosure actions on those consumers who had stopped making payments. This was true even though the parties to whom they were making payments, were not collecting on behalf of any party who owned the debt by virtue of having paid money for ownership of the debt and the rights to enforce it.

But since the loan receivable had been converted from asset to income they had to create the appearance that the conversion had never occurred. And that is why we saw widespread fabrication, forgery and Robo signing of backdated documents that referred to nonexistent transactions. In reality it is simply not possible that anyone in the chain of title could have paid any money for ownership of the debt and the rights to enforce it; this was simply because none of those parties had ever funded the origination or acquisition of the debt. All attributes of the debt and all revenue streams or profits from treating indirectly on the debt were sold for profit in which the participants in that revenue stream received at least 11 times the amount of the purported “loan.” As part of the cover-up most of the revenue stream was reported as return of capital, implying that the conversion to income had never occurred. This enabled avoidance of substantial income taxes on regular trading income.

The taxes lost to State and Federal Government were far in excess of the cost of various packages that were used to stimulate the economy after the crash caused by the very same investment bankers who had cheated the government out of the receipt of tax revenues, cheated homeowners, and cheated investors.
 
In the recent Complaint filed by the Department of Justice against XXXX  , the insiders who were trading digitized certificates and contracts deriving value from an index that referred to a group of loans that were not owned by any of the participants, referred to the “pooling” and the derivatives as a bag of XXXX whose value was something less then XXXX. And that is what is being enforced in foreclosure courts across the country. And somehow most homeowners continue to experience feelings of shame and regret for not giving even more revenue to players who will already profited in XXXX proportions to any money that was loaned. Those homeowners think that they are either paying a debt if they are making monthly payments, or they are giving up their house to pay a debt. If that was true, that none of the fabrication of documents, forgery or Robo signing would have been necessary. 

Thus, a full validation of my debt to XXXX aka BOA;  and Adequate Assurance that I deal with a legitimate company, not with a bundle of the same criminals  who once crashed US economy is absolutely mandatory.  I respectfully request you to intervene and ORDER BOA, XXXX, and their co-conspirators to compensate me for ALL damages, in the amount no less that (1) 15% royalties from trades on my name, signature and reputation; (2) treble damages for fraud and forgery;( 3) treble damages for racket; (4) damages for extreme emotional distress while dealing with BOA RICO enterprise who as of today is engaged in a wide-spree crimes. 

BOA found it lucrative to gamble with lives and homes  of veterans like myself, with gross disregard to all damages their criminal conduct can cause. The laughable settlements paid by BOA with other people money only made fraud more attractive since BOA acts with total impunity and not afraid to defraud borrowers as much as they want.

176,2020-02-26,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Privacy issues,"I have now had two calls with Chase bank over this issue. The first was on Friday, XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX, lasting 37 minutes and 26 seconds. The second was on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX, lasting 1 hour, 18 minutes, and 18 seconds. I have been told Chase is unable to provide additional assistance with resolving the issue, which I do not believe to be true. 

On Friday, XX/XX/2020, I attempted to create an online account for my new credit card. When I created my account, I received a two-factor authentication request with an authentication sent to a phone number I did not recognize. I had to call in to the online support team in order to gain access to my account, as I was unable to authenticate. Once I was in the account, and over the course of my conversation with support, I could see the primary number associated with my account was the aforementioned number I was not associated with. My phone number, the number I used in my application for the credit card, was listed as the secondary number. The support employee removed the incorrect phone number listed as primary before I had a chance to write down the number, but I believe it to have ended to the effect of XXXX. She escalated the issue to an investigator who was supposed to call me back on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020. 

I received a call-back from the investigator on Wednesday XX/XX/2020 who could not provide any additional information as to why the number was associated with my account. As it was a credit card issue, she transferred me to the credit card team. The credit card team employee I spoke with could not assist me, and escalated me to his supervisor. His supervisor said it appeared to be fraud to him, and transferred me to the fraud team. The fraud team said they did not see any evidence of another number existing on my account, and suggested transferring me to another team. I was then transferred back to the online account team. The online account team transferred me back to the credit card team. I was then escalated to a supervisor on the credit card team, who escalated me up another level to someone with elevated access. 

The person I was escalated to was unable to help me understand why that number was associated with my account, and was able to confirm I do not have any other associations with Chase Accounts ( which is not a surprise to me, as I have not had a Chase account ). I had heard from her, and a couple of other employees, that having another Chase account could have caused the system to associate a primary number on those accounts to this new credit card, but that does not appear to be the case. I also correctly input my phone number when I initially submitted my application, another common cause of error, as my phone number was correct and associated with the account - as its primary number. 

I believe having a primary number associated with my account that I did not add, and should not have been associated with my account to begin with, to be a significant privacy and account security risk. I was not provided an explanation as to why this may have occurred. I was transferred in a circle, and transferred/escalated a total of 8 times over the course of an hour and a half, with not a single employee able to assist me. I was finally told by the employee with elevated privileges that there was no-one she could transfer me to that could assist in investigating the root cause of this number association.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,91505.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-02-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3545293

The items that were shipped were of the substandard quality I believe PayPal misleads public by offering case resolution and protection services when in fact, it sides up with fraudulent merchants without giving customers a chance to recover money.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a {$4700.00} balance transfer from my BoA account to my XXXX XXXX account. The transfer posted to my BoA account on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had autopay setup through BoA 's bill pay system, and it autodrafted my previous account balance of {$4400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This meant my XX/XX/XXXX BoA statement had a New Balance Total of - {$4300.00} with a Minimum Payment Due of {$0.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. The Important Messages section on Page 4 of the statement clearly says "" You have a credit balance and do not need to make a payment on your account. '' I did not routinely check my BoA account or bank account after verifying the balance transfer had posted, so when I noticed this draft from my bank account I was very upset and called BoA. They indicated they had no control over the e-bill system and didn't know what had happened. I requested they refund the payment, which they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX. I verified the money was back in my bank account and didn't think anything else needed to be done. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use my BoA card online and it was denied. When I logged into my account, it showed my account was past due and that I had missed a payment. I double checked my XXXX statement and verified it showed {$0.00} minimum payment due by XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I was very upset, so rather than call BoA I used their online chat system. I believe the representative I dealt with was XXXX. She initially said I'd missed a payment, then after 30 minutes of back and forth explaining the situation to her, she credited the {$25.00} missed payment fee, and said she had fixed the account. 

I assumed the issue was taken care of until I tried to use my card online today and it was once again denied. This time I called BoA and had to go through the whole scenario again. The first rep explained that I'd missed a payment in XXXX that was caused by BoA refunding my XXXX payment. I explained my XXXX statement shows there is {$0.00} due so there was no way I could have missed a payment. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor. The supervisor looked at the account, noted that the {$25.00} had been credited on XX/XX/XXXX, but then said I should have made a minimum payment in XXXX and that there was nothing she could do about it other than take a payment today. I once again pointed out the XXXX statement and she told me that you have to make a payment every month, which is ludicrous.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",TX,79413.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-08,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3558766

I have never had a Wells Fargo Credit Card. I was a customer of Wells Fargo at one time but left for XXXX XXXX  when I left my XXXX marriage. Wells Fargo refused to let me remove my name from the account that was linked with my husband at the time. I started trying to call WF XX/XX/XXXX to learn what this debt was. XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a packet of bills with an address different than what it should have been. They advised the card was opened in XXXX. This is the year I left my marriage and started banking with a new bank. I looked at the charges and didn't recognize them. Some of the charges were in a different state than I lived in. I called to advise them of this and they said they would open and investigation. I waited about 2 months and didn't hear anything back so I called again. They advised no investigation was ever started. They put me on hold for 45 minutes as they were "" looking into it '' then hung up on me. I called back. They advised that they could see an investigation had been started and I would hear from someone. I asked how I would hear from them and they couldn't answer. I had to force them to take my new contact information. I waited 2 more months and again heard nothing. I called back again but this time to the corporate office. They listened to my complaints about nothing ever happening. Assured me an investigation would happen and that they would personally call me back. They confirmed the address that the address was opened in and I advised that was NOT my address at the time. They also said that my name was the only name on the account. I never received a call back but I did receive a letter and a check for {$270.00} for all of my trouble. I was advised that it had been removed off of my report. I thought it was done. A couple of weeks later I received a letter stating that my report was denied and they found it to be my debt. I called and told them I wanted proof and they told me they couldn't provide me with proof that they didn't have to and that they were going to put it back on my credit report. I contacted the corporate office again and complained. Again they assured me that the case manager would reopen the investigation and that she would personally call me back. They told me to wait until XX/XX/XXXX and if I hadn't heard from her to call her directly. I have called her several times and she will not return my call. I received a letter from her stating the debt is mine only this time they sent completely different invoices before and this time they have my then underage daughters name on the account as well. I have called multiple times to ask someone about the discrepancies and they refuse to call me back or provide legitimate proof that this debt is mine. I am fully aware that Wells Fargo was in a lot of trouble for their employees opening credit accounts in customers names without their permission.

313,2019-05-16,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Traveler's check or cashier's check,Fraud or scam,,"COMPLAIN AGAINST WELLS FARGO ON ITS FAILURE TO PROTECT ME AGAINST SCAM. 
This is to bring to your notice that a bank I trusted enough to open a checking account with had failed in one of  its statutory responsibilities of protecting its customer against scams and fraudsters. 
Up until XX/XX/2018 I had a robust relationship with the bank but an event which began on that day had left me traumatized and lost hope in the financial institution- Wells Fargo XXXX 
I got a priority mail on the XX/XX/XXXX with an offer of Secret Shoppers job. A check of {$1300.00} was enclosed ( please see paper marked X1 and X5 ). In my innocence I thought I had gotten a job and I followed the instructions on the letter to the latter. 
I did a report as instructed ( X3 and X4. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alarming alert that my account had been overdrawn to the tune of {$1000.00}, the alert came at about XXXX and throughout that night I was unable to close my eyes wondering what could have gone wrong. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I made my way to the bank and it was then the bank told me that the check I lodged in was reversed and that it was fraudsters that had set me up. The receipts of the purchases from XXXX and XXXX is marked X7 with the cards I sent to the scammers as instructed by them. 
I was advised to put up a claim and I did. A photocopy of the check was given to me ( X5 ) and I went to the police station in XXXX XXXX to lodge a complaint. Officer XXXX XXXX with badge number XXXX attended to me and he expressed that the occurrence is a very common one. 
My grouse however with Wells Fargo is why would it give me money that was not available in the account of whoever issued the check? Does that mean anybody can issue a check without money in their account to the detriment of the check receiver? I know banks in this country that would withhold check for 24 hours in order to be sure it is not a bounced check, why would Wells Fargo not do the same? 
The staff that attended to me at the bank also attest to the fact that the bank witnesses such occurrence all the time and the question is, what measure has the bank put in place to checkmate this fraud, does that means scammers will be left out there to have their way and subject innocent customers to trauma and heart breaking situation? I got the letter ( X6 ) from the bank few days later and a claim was initiated but I was informed by the bank after some weeks that the claim was denied. 
Few weeks later, I got another priority mail from the same people with the same instruction but a higher amount on the check ( please see X2 ). ( The accompanied letter is the first 2 pages on the scanned documents ).  Apparently they felt the first one had scaled through so they launched another attack. I went straight to the bank to show the check and the letter, the bank made a photocopy of the check and gave me saying they needed to withdraw the original. I also went back to Officer XXXX XXXX who advised that I should just ignore it. Now my take on this is that if the bank had done the needful and the first check didnt go through, the scammers will not have the audacity to send another check to me. 
I am concern about my own reputation and I think the bank should also be concerned on how customers perceive its services. The incident made me to close my account because I lost confidence in the operation of the bank. Recently, the bank has been calling me that I am in debt and that is why I am putting up this official complain to defend myself and for the bank to live up to its responsibility of protecting its customers. Leaving its customers in the cold in the hands of scammers is sending a wrong signal about the reputation of the bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MD,20774.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3244850

They would not initially identify themselves when they first started calling me so I never responded. When I was notified of legal action, I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX - XXXX  and was notified of the debt. They told me I had to pay the full amount {$2700.00}, which I could not and then they said I could try and enter a payment arrangement if I paid {$190.00} at the time of the call and then subsequently {$100.00} a month until the debt was paid in full. I agreed to pay the {$190.00} and then {$100.00} a month following that on the XX/XX/XXXX of every month. They stated that legal action would stop so long as I made my payments on time and that if I defaulted on payments legal action would continue and a judgment would be entered against me which could result in me losing my job possibly, according to them. I said okay, and paid. I paid {$190.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and then {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I checked my credit score at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX and it showed they were still reporting the balance owed of {$2700.00}, and were reporting that I had not made any payments. It stated on my XXXX  credit report that the last time they had updated information was in XXXX of XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX - XXXX in XXXX and asked if they could update the debt to reflect the accurate balance and that I had indeed made three payments at this point. They gave me the run around and transferred me and gave me different phone numbers to call and after 2 hours, I was told no one was trained on "" Credit Reporting '' and that they would not update the correct balance or payments until the balance was paid in full. They could not give me any assurance of when that would be reported or if it would officially be reported to Credit Bureaus or just reported in XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX - XXXX systems. I was told not to dispute, just to be patient and keep paying as I had agreed or legal action would resume. I was told that they could see in their records that they were aware they were reporting the incorrect balance and inaccurate payment details and they showed the last time they had updated or reported anything about the debt was 5 months prior in XXXX. I then contacted XXXX  and disputed this debt as they were reporting inaccurate balance amount and inaccurate payment history of the debt. I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that the dispute was successful and that the debt was being deleted from my Credit Report and my Credit Score went up. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX - XXXX and informed them of the dispute and that the debt was deleted from my Credit Score and I asked if I was still legally required to pay the debt. They would not answer me and laughed at me twice. They asked me if I only pay my debts when I'm forced legally or if I pay out of moral responsibility. I asked multiple times, "" Am I legally required to keep paying now that the debt was disputed and removed from my Credit Report '' and they would not answer. The first agent I spoke with offered right away after her system showed that the debt was disputed, to cancel my payment plan, and I asked again, am I still required to pay, or not, since the debt was deleted and disputed, she would not answer. I was transferred to two different supervisors and after 1.5 hours, I was told if I didn't continue to pay, they would restart the lawsuit, possibly garnish my bank account and that I would have a judgement entered against me, but would not answer if I was legally required to keep paying on a deleted debt. They would not answer and kept repeating the question to me "" do you only pay bills when you are legally forced ''?. They would not answer me and after so long, and speaking with two supervisors, who would not give me their real name, I gave up. I still do not have any answer and don't know if I'm supposed to keep paying or not.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MI,48237.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-06-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3685331

323,2019-09-24,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the  claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance  of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,33180.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3384381

We found someone that was approved by management and everything was set for that individual to take over our lease on XX/XX/XXXX. We also stated we would be cleaning our apartment ourselves and the manager had someone come in to clean the apartment while we were still moving out, even though we communicated that we would not be paying to have someone clean the apartment. While moving out, the manager called me and stated that the replacement tenant "" may not work out '' because his XXXX photos had skulls in them and they were "" scary. '' I was told a few days later by the manager that the replacement tenant was no longer going to be taking the apartment ( even though he was trying to pay his first month of rent and still wanted the apartment ) and that the manager would be able to find someone to move into our apartment within one week of us moving out. I never heard anything else from XXXX until the end of XX/XX/XXXX when the manager asked for our new address. The manager stated we would have some "" move-out '' charges and apologized. I received a bill two weeks later for XX/XX/XXXX rent and cleaning fees, etc. I tried contacting XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( who manages XXXX ) throughout XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which I also have proof of. I was trying to dispute the charges based on the evidence we had in communication with the manager saying we would owe nothing further. I would have been happy to pay the charges if I could have spoken with someone and worked something out. However, I received no return phone calls or emails from XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert, saying my credit score had decreased by 60 points. I am in the middle of purchasing a home and this was very concerning for me. I investigated why my credit score had plummeted and found that XXXX XXXX XXXX had sent our bill to collections. I received no communication from XXXX XXXX XXXX or from the collection agency ( United Accounts in XXXX ND ) about this issue. My fiance and I had many phone and email conversations with XXXX XXXX XXXX after finding out things had been sent to collections. XXXX XXXX XXXX said that there was nothing that they could do and recommended that we pay our balance with United Accounts. Since XX/XX/XXXX, my fiance and I have tried contacting United Accounts approximately thirty times in total ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) trying to pay our bill. We have left many voicemails for United Accounts with no return phone calls. We have taken screen shots of reviews of United Accounts on  XXXX, because many people have experienced the same thing as us and say that it is "" impossible '' to get ahold of United Accounts. We still have received zero correspondence from United Accounts and never would have known that this went to collections if we had not been paying close attention to our credit scores. This is very frustrating and we have many emails and texts to back up all of these claims.

404,2019-05-22,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I consolidated with XXXX XXXX in XXXX to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) plan, when I realized that I was not eligible for this benefit while my loans were with XXXX XXXX. ( I have worked for the same non-profit 501 ( c ) 3 organization since XXXX. ) As soon as I learned of the PLSF program, I aimed to learn the rules of the plan and submitted all of my paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX to consolidate from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX was terrible about communicating the rules of the program, but I did my research online and followed the guidelines. After making two payments under the standard repayment plan, I read online that only income-based repayments are eligible for PLSF. I submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX for IBR, which took months to process, and I got on the IBR plan beginning XX/XX/XXXX. My loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX ( now defunct ) to XXXX in XXXX, and then to Fed Loan in XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF )  program were miscounted, resulting in approximately 16 missing payments from my eligible payment count. I have tried for months to work with FedLoan Servicing to rectify this issue, but I am very unhappy with the progress of this review. I have asked repeatedly, both by email and phone, for a full history of the student loan payments I've made to all 3 servicers. Both the Department of Education Ombudsman Group and Fed Loan verbally confirmed the payments I made over the telephone, but they refuse to submit this to me in writing. Fedloan has sent me 3 different cryptic, disorganized documents that do not in any way show a full payment history, and they truly lack any semblance of reason. One document had transaction codes with no legend/key for the codes and 50-75 different transactions, many in the amount of {$0.00} or other random small amounts. This is completely unacceptable service for a student loan company to offer a borrower. 

Furthermore, FedLoan has advised me that nearly a year of payments I made in XXXX cant be counted toward PSLF because I was on an "" administrative forbearance '' at this time. I have proof that I was billed during this time, made hefty monthly payments, and I did not request any type of forbearance on my account for those months. I would have never made the financially crippling payments if they weren't being counted toward my loan program! This is obviously an administrative error and must be corrected. 

Fedloan has also advised me that some payments I made could not be counted toward PSLF because my payment was one cent off from the actual amount due. I have sent them records showing that my monthly amount due was indeed the amount I paid. A few other payments were a XXXX or a few dollars off because I paid a few dollars extra on a month prior when I would sometimes round up to the nearest dollar when making a payment. Beyond this, there were several other payments that Fedloan says do not count towards the PSLF program for one unfair reason or another. I work in public service, and I have struggled to make these payments. I've paid around {$30000.00} of interest only payments to date. My original loan balance was around {$47000.00} ... with compounding interest each month, my balance has increased to {$60000.00}. My only hope for ever ending this overwhelming debt is the PSLF program. Fedloan is making unfair, inhumane decisions with regard to PLSF and it is very evident that they've grossly mismanaged my student loans. I have never made a late payment and have held up my end of the contract as the consumer. Fedloan has breached the contract with me, the loan holder, by not keeping proper records of my payment eligibility, and by never informing me that being paid ahead by even a XXXX could affect my status. ( This information is buried on their website, but in the emails I get each month about my bill it actually gives encouraging tips about paying ahead! ) Furthermore, it is completely unacceptable to not fulfill my request for a full payment history in 3 months time when I am currently making monthly payments in the amount of over {$410.00} to this company! 

I have followed the PSLF program to the letter, frequently certifying my employment for the program. Ive read online about people who werent with the right loan servicer for PSLF, or in the wrong payment plan for years and who are now upset that their payments dont count and have appealed for inclusion in the program. Meanwhile, I did my research and properly followed the program, only to have XXXX instruction or accountability from XXXX XXXX and then my payments mishandled and incorrectly counted by FedLoan! This program is supposed to reward people for work in the public sector. Its become a cryptic, unfair game that is impossible to navigate and has resulted in an insurmountable level of debt! I have a young son, and our entire future rests on me completing this program as soon as possible. I have already been working with the FedLoan Ombudsman group for 3 months. The staff is abrasive and unsympathetic.

410,2019-02-22,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I refinanced my home loan with NationStar XX/XX/XXXX. Upon closing, without notifying me or bringing it to my attention they removed my Flood insurance from my escrow account ** ( per CFPB they have to disclose this information at closing. They never did ). In XX/XX/XXXX my flood insurance was due and did not get paid. I received notice of cancellation and immediately called Nationstar. They told me it was not a part of my escrow and if i wanted them to pay it I needed to talk to the escrow dept. So they transferred me to Escrow. I asked for them to pay my flood insurance and they said they would. * ( this didn't go smoothly there was a lot of back and forth ). Two months later my flood policy was cancelled due to non payment. Then I received a letter from Nationstar telling me they purchased lender placed Flood Insurance for me, which was 3 times the amount of my policy thru XXXX. According to my research with CFPB Subject to the requirements of 1024.37 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) through ( iii ), if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, a servicer may charge a borrower for force-placed insurance the servicer purchased, retroactive to the first day of any period of time in which the borrower did not have hazard insurance in place. I had my insurance they spoke to XXXX. I could not believe it I lost my Grandfathered rate which was {$1400.00} annually and now my insurance is over {$3700.00}. This mess has made my escrow account so low that it has raised my monthly payments over {$500.00} a month.so high. I am a single mom with XXXX growing children. This was not in my budget. I fell behind when my payments went up and by XXXX XXXX  my home was in Foreclosure.

With the help of 1 agent who actually listened to me and started to dig into my account I was finally able to breath. She escalated it to her supervisor and who eventually my account was with Customer Relations VP and I thought I was finally going to get this resolved. By XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed me a deal where Nationstar dba MrCooper was going to offer me a modification where I still have to take the hit. and my payment was still over {$1500.00}. WHAT how is that helping me. Then I turned to CFPB and an attorney and that is when they offered to pay me the difference on my flood insurance policy for 5 years which is over {$11000.00} and they would modify my loan doing a partial claim. ( still don't know why I am having to take the hit ) and my payment was down to {$1200.00}. But that does not include Flood insurance. I wanted to think about it this was a big deal to me and I was so confused ( still am ). I reached out and called MrCooper to talk about the offer and the agent I spoke to had no clue what I was talking about he just kept telling me I had to either pay the Trial payment or I needed to pay over {$19000.00} and bring my account current. I sent a request to have my credit fixed and that was denied. No help at all in fact it made me so angry because I felt lied to i felt like I had been taken advantage of and scammed. Every time i spoke to someone it was something different but no one knew about the deal XXXX had offered me. I was so angry how could this still be going on.

With fear that I was not going to have a home I decided I would take the offer. I called and they said no sorry you did not accept the offer it has been denied. So I tried for a modification and i was denied since I did not take the last offer.

How is this okay. How can anyone expect me to trust this offer without getting answers to my questions and after I have been to XXXX  and back 5 times over. I have lost all good standing on my credit. My credit card limits gone. Credit cards cancelled. Phone calls, flyers about bankruptcy and foreclosure. I have not been able to eat, sleep, I have even started to see a counselor for my anxiety. All I am asking is for anyone reading this is to take a minute and think about what you would be feeling if this happened to you I never imagined this could ever happen. I thought with a phone call I could get this fixed its been 2 years I have lived this nightmare. I need someone to realize this is not easy for me to write this, I don't like conflict and I certainly don't know what else to do. I don't have money to keep paying a lawyer.

435,2019-03-07,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX, my credit monitoring service. It informed me that my credit score had dropped and that Diversified Consultants had illegally posted a collection account I have never heard of nor had an account with this company. My report shows that it was opened on XX/XX/XXXX with a balance of {$1200.00}. I have no know knowledge of this company nor this debt. I have never had an account with them. I never receive a letter in the mail that gave me 30 days to validate or dispute this account. I never received a letter stating that I have an alleged debt with this company and owe a balance on that account. I have always understood that, if I receive a letter from a debt collector and do not respond within 30 days, they can automatically assume that the alleged debt is mine. Again, I have absolutely no knowledge of this account with them. I understand that, under the FDCPA guidelines for collection agencies, that, in order for me to go further with this account, I need ( 1 ) proof that they are the original holder of this debt and can legally hold me responsible for paying this debt and ( 2 ) contractual proof of obligation or an assignment SIGNED in BLUE ink from an officer from the original creditors corporation that I am supposed to pay them. 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) grants me the right to request validation of this alleged debt they say I owe. If I would have gotten anything in the mail from this company before they illegally reported to my credit report, I would have responded immediately within the 30 days by acknowledging that I have no knowledge of this debt with them and would have respectfully requested evidence that I am the person they are asking to pay this debt and a contractual obligation that legally binds me to pay them this debt. Upon them receiving my validation affidavit, they would have to legally cease from collection calls, letters, and efforts and delete the account from my credit files until they can legally validate this debt. But again, I never received such a letter about this account ever in the mail. They have illegally posted and reported to my credit file file without adhering to the FDCPA laws. When I got the email on XX/XX/XXXX, I proceeded to contact them via phone number that was listed on the account ( XXXX ) to find out more about this alleged debt and illegal reporting. The automated line said my call would be transferred to a customer service, but I was continuously left on hold. There is no other contact information, but by phone. Im not sure if this a scam or someone is attempting to hack my credit file or not. What I do know is that this company has broken FCRA and FDCPA laws but reporting a false account to my credit report without informing me through mail, email, phone, etc. My credit score has dropped tremendously in the middle of purchasing a home. Please help me get his account removed immediately. I have spoken to a consumer protection attorney who is prepared to sue this company for punitive damages for illegal debt collection practice violation under the FCRA and FDCPA because of the damages to my credit and opportunity costs with the purchase of my home and business ventures that have to be delayed until this illegal account is removed.

When I realized I clicked the wrong amount, I called the customer service phone number and talked to an agent named XXXX ( sp? ) who was unable to reverse even though I called her 2 minutes after. She stated that I would have to wait 10 Calendar days to reverse the payment and for me to call back on XX/XX/19. I heard her actually counting out the days while I was on the phone with her. On XX/XX/19 the amount was deducted from my checking account. On XX/XX/19, I called customer service at USAA again and talked to XXXX and she said it would be a reversed in 10 BUSINESS days after amount was cleared. On XX/XX/19, I called again and talked to XXXX and she said the reversal would be made that day and gave me a case number. During that call, she put me on hold and checked with someone else to make sure that could be done on XX/XX/XXXX ; and it was confirmed Today XX/XX/19, still no credit of said amount into my checking account. I called and talked to XXXX at USAA and she said that XXXX made a mistake and the it was to be 10 business day from XX/XX/19 for reversed payment. I asked to talk to a supervisor as I was confused as to exactly when my refund would be made. After 32 minutes on hold, I was connected to XXXX in the resolution center of USAA. She put me on hold as she looked into my issue. She came back to tell me that no direct reversal of credit to my bank was possible and I only had 2 options : 1 : Send a check to me which would take 2 days for the work order and another 10 days to be approved or 2 : Have a cash advance made through my back ( would charge me ).

She said that even though I was told by the above agents that this could be done ; she could not address what I was told, even though she saw all calls documented in their data. 

I am currently out of country and have a US address for all mail, but I'm not physically there to deposit the check. 

She had no other options for me. I was on the phone a total of 1 hour and 6 minutes with no resolution of the matter.

Now ; why did all other agents say a direct reversal was possible, but there was different details as to whether it would be 10 calendar vs. business days ; and what date would the count down begin : day of payment to USAA or date cleared by my bank. XXXX also told me that day didn't count either. 

I asked that the check be mailed overnight, but she could not guarantee that could be done. So ... .it will be possible that I would have to wait 32 or more days from payment of the credit card to resolution IF I can figure out how to deposit the check. And by the way, my bank will hold the deposit for 3 days as well. So, 35 or more days!!

As far as I'm concerned, this is not fair banking practice and I should be protected by the Fair Banking Act. To the least this is poor practice and no care for the consumer and my more than {$3000.00}.

552,2019-06-17,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,"Was approved for a loan, but didn't receive money",,"This is actually me having to re-open this complaint since One Main took over a month and still did not address my issues. My previous complaint consisted of : How can an already established customer who always make on-time payments for over a year, start off being approved by the lender up until you actually meet with their representative? This is how ... I contacted them to apply for a loan for an emergency and they told me approximately 24 hours later that I was approved as long as I bring in pretty much the same documents I was required to bring in the last loan I received through them. I brought in the documents and the minute she approached me ( the XXXX  XXXX ) I immediately assumed she must've been having a bad day since her attitude, demeanor, and commentary was nothing like what I had experienced while speaking with her on the phone. I attempted to cheer her up by being complimenting but her attitude just continued to get worse. Then she started asking me for whatever documents she can come up with ( e.g, birth certificates, credit card & bank statements ) that had nothing to do with the list of requirements she expressed to me over the phone or nothing similar to the list of documents that I had to bring to them my last closing. It was then that I realized that she was attempting to figure out a way to turn me away for no other reason but my appearance since her attitude was nothing of the sort over the phone. My first loan officer was thorough, friendly, and willing to answer all questions since it was my first loan ever. This different/new One Main rep told me she no longer needed the documents and will get back to me the next morning. The next day she called to informed me that even though I had once been approved they decided to deny me and they will send me a letter with an explanation and she was rude enough to hang right up on me. Weeks later they sent me a letter stating only that I was denied and I would have to make a request in writing if I wanted to know the specific reason for their decision. Over a month later they sent me another letter saying that an application that I had never been given was incomplete. I had done everything I was expected to do, I maintained a great credit history with ONe Main with their extremely high interest rates, I brought in all documents required which included the same employer from the first loan, I even showed up to my appointment when asked and I still got mistreated and told anything. I am attaching both correspondences I received back from One Main regarding this loan.

-concluded- Since this complaint over a month later One Main finally responds back alleging that, even though I exercised my right and had requested from them in writing the reason for their decision of denying me, my verification of income indicated fraud. Yet, their reason given upon request ( still attached ) said "" incomplete application ''. They did not even take the time to verify the authenticity of my income as they did with my prior loan approval with them they just jumped to the conclusion that it resembled fraud, yet their false accusations does not explain why their representative from the beginning before exchanging any documents, was so rude and negative towards me the moment she saw me. It also does not explain why this representative acted as if she had requested me to bring in documents that I did not bring or why I would suddenly need my birth certificate, credit card & bank statements. How does a format constitutes me suddenly needing to conjure up never mentioned before documents. Just because the exact same employer that was already verified during my first One Main loan that was approved decides to use a format that resembles with what you label as fraud does not change not a single fact. The verification of income could have easily been verified besides just looking at the XXXX of ones skin or a format on paper just like the previous representative managed to verify my income through my exact same employer. The fact is still evident by their own admittance that my rights was violated since I do reserve the right to know why I was denied upon request, and One Main denied me that right. 
One Main also claimed to be "" committed '' to being non-discriminatory, yet, instead of recognizing that one obviously slipped through the cracks and attempting to repair it they decide to use defense tactics and point the finger since I am just one person and they are a whole company that still managed to take over a month to come up with a reply that still violates my rights.",,"ONEMAIN FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, LLC.",MI,48073.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3276938

604,2019-03-27,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"In XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Wells Fargo about a pending XXXX   XXXX and retiring from my work of 24 years as a result. On XX/XX/XXXX I retired. Throughout XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I submitted paperwork of what my income would be after retiring and on XX/XX/XXXX I received a Forbearance Agreement whereby I would pay {$25.00} per month for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. At the end of that period I again spoke with Wells Fargo representatives and reiterated that I needed a permanent reduction in my mortgage payment. In XXXX of XXXX, I received a Trial Period Plan for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I received Loan Modification paperwork, but I had many questions which were not answered before the deadline for this modification. Calls to Wells Fargo representatives went unanswered and the deadline passed. A letter was sent to the representative on the loan modification paperwork with my questions with a copy sent to my customer service representative. I did not hear from either one. In XX/XX/XXXX I was assigned a new customer service representative and a letter was received from a WF rep saying they were looking into my questions. At the end of XXXX, a second loan modification request was submitted. A letter for trial period payments to begin In XX/XX/XXXX was received in XXXX, however, the same questions remained as I had not gotten any answers ( questions included principal balance shown in the modification agreement, where had payments already made been applied, why they weren't using the income figures submitted on the applications/it was being multiplied by a formula designed to arrive at the gross figure but the gross figure was verified by social security ). The modification was denied in XX/XX/XXXX, An appeal was filed which was also denied. After a phone call with their escrow department in XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted paperwork for a third modification. Received a letter involving short sale option dated XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I had a LONG conversation with an executive representative who finally explained the questions I submitted after the first trial period in XX/XX/XXXX. Third modification was denied despite my explanations of why I had not accepted the first two offers ( third modification requested a return to the first modification offer, if possible ). Appeal submitted and denied. I now owed a little under 24,000 and my credit was in the tank. 

1. I apparently have a XXXX XXXX loan which would have been eligible for HARP at the time I asked for a lower payment. Is it not the lender 's responsibility to lay out this option? 

2. The monthly payment returned to 93.25 % of my monthly income. 

3. To avoid foreclosure, I withdrew IRA funds to pay the balance owed. This amounted to half of my retirement cushion. 

4. The HARP program expired in XX/XX/XXXX 5. Because the modification process results in delinquent credit reporting, I am not eligible to try and refinance at this time. 

I feel lenders owe their clients to discuss ALL options when trying to reduce their payments. When a client has made payments on time, every time for the length of the loan, I do not understand how they can be denied a modification, especially with good reason.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MT,59860.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3192747

'' XXXX comes around and I received a bill for over {$800.00} which Toyota Financial informed me consisted of the disposition fee and charges for tires. I replaced the old tires with brand new tires the day before I turned the lease in and when I told this to Toyota Financial they told me the charge was because the doughnut tire did not match the rest. They agreed this did not make any sense and agreed to waive the tire charges. However, they would not work with me when I attempted to discuss the disposition fee I was told I would not owe. 

Since then I have called back numerous times trying to speak with a manager/supervisor to which I am told none are available and they will not allow me to hold to speak to one and refused to call me back.

I attempted to call today XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they can not pull the call I had with their agent on XX/XX/XXXX because it was with their customer service department and not their lease end department so there is nothing they can do. 

I informed them I am willing to start paying $ XXXX/month on this account as money is tight for me. They advised me I can pay that amount, but when the account is reviewed it will be sent to collections because their monthly minimum is $ XXXX/month. I work in XXXX and to the best of my knowledge it is absolutely illegal to send a customer who is making payments to collections and accounts can not be reported to a consumers credit when payments are actively being made. I relayed this information to the agent and she held firm with her $ XXXX/month or else I would be sent to collections. I wanted to get her saying this on a recorded line so I informed her she was now being recorded and she told me that she will not speak to me on a recorded line and eventually hung up on me.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into XXXX account to check for activity on my XXXX XXXX store card, which is also an American Express card. While I use the store card side of it regularly, I very seldom use the American Express side. 

When you go the account information feature, there is no balance information on the page. One needs to click to access that information. I have always found that unusual, as all my other accounts have the balance on the main page. 

When I clicked, I saw that there was a balance of {$250.00} on the American Express side. Again, because I seldom use it, I had no recollection of making a purchase, so I called XXXX XXXX thinking it was a fraudulent transaction. This was after I had attempted to see the original charge, which I could not access. I was able to access recent late fees charges in the amounts of {$38.00} each ( there were four ). 

When I reached Customer Service on XX/XX/XXXX, I explained the situation and was told that I had had a transaction in XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I immediately remembered that I had purchased some concert tickets in a pre-sale, so that indeed was my transaction. She said that my account was past due and gave me an amount, which I quickly paid that same day ( {$150.00} : I paid the remaining {$98.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ). The customer service rep also said that, as a courtesy, she would remove two late charge fees. 

I proceeded to ask her why I had not gotten any notifications from them about these past due charges. She said that statements had been mailed to me. I swear to you that I did not receive any statements. ( In XXXX XXXX defense, however, I have someone in my neighborhood who has the same house number, but lives on a different street, and I very often get his mail delivered to my house, so this may have occurred. ) I also never got a phone call, e-mail, or any other type of correspondence about my account being past due. Yet, I almost get daily e-mails from XXXXXXXX XXXX with special offers. 

While I know that the store can not babysit me, and I am responsible for making my payments on time, this was an oversight that I could have instantly remedied by getting a reminder. I wonder if this is a tactic used to charge people late fees. Also, I have always questioned why the balance on one 's account does not immediately pop up on the XXXXXXXX XXXX website as it does in others. 

Needless to say, I checked my FICO score and it had dropped 93 points ( from an XXXX ). 

In 26 years I have not had a late payment. I would not risk ruining my credit score for such a small amount. 

Coincidentally, within two days, I received a statement saying my account was late, as well as a notification that they had been trying to reach me by phone. They were mailed to me before my call to XXXX XXXX, but about 120 days after my original transaction. 

I want to know why, and I want my original credit score reinstated.

To Whom This May Be concern Or to Whom May care Greetings! 
It has been quite a few years that I use a credit monitoring via EQUIFAX which I pay dutifully every month. 
One of the service [ or options ] that comes with the package is that a consumer/member [ who pays for the service, like me ] can place a credit alert on their credit file in all major credit bureaus via Equifax and no other action is required. 
So, I placed the credit alert on my files online ; of course, I did it with no interference of another human being. 
This arrangement worked fine for a few years that is, until I decided to remove the credit alert. 
However, when I decided to remove the credit alert it has created all sorts of bureaucracy : 1 ) Equifax did NOT accept that I remove the credit alert online via their own service which I use placed it!

2 ) I had to call them and when I declined to provide my full SS # over the phone ( * ) he asked several questions about information containing on my credit records that I should be familiar with. I do not mind the probe however the probe went well over half an hour which I think it was excessive : I wonder if it was only because I did no want to give my full SS # over the phone? Which I think has been grossly abused. 
3 ) So, I thought that once I had placed the credit alert via my service which I pay to Equifax would suffice for the other credit bureaus also to remove the credit alert in tandem once that it was placed via Equifax wrong again, Watson! Equifax sent me a letter instructing me that, if I wanted the credit alert to be removed from the other bureaus, I had to contact to each of them directly AND independently from Equifax. 
4 ) Accordingly, at first, I tried to accomplish it online, directly on their respective websites where each of them have links which suggest that it can be done that way, that is online! 
5 ) Wrong again!!! After going the whole process each of them denied me then asked that I sent documents via USPS. 
6 ) XXXX sports the worse interface : It does time out! however, their site does NOT offer any indication on how long the consumer has to upload the required documents and/or write notes on the provided windows of what is been sought I bank online and pay credit cards online they all indicate how long I have until it time out and some DO OFFER option for me to extend the visit : So technology DOES exist for those who want to offer a pleasant customer experience!!! 
a. After several attempts, I was able to upload whatever documents they ask Mission accomplished? Wrong again! Several days later they sent me an email asking for the procedure to be repeated via USPS! and they gave a list of required documents that I had already uploaded to XXXX website b. Interesting enough I uploaded my request on link on their site that says alert removal ironical!! Why do they post such link? 
== > Please note : I do have screen shots to document my ordeal and I will not upload to the CFPB website, feel free to request it. However, I will send a hard copy to XXXX along this letter via USPS certified mail. 
Therefore, I come back to the question I posed on the beginning of this complaint : Re. : Removing Credit Alert : Are the Credit Bureaus Making Placing A Credit Alert Intentionally More Difficult Than It should be? 
Given my experience, it seems that way. they do not want consumers to place credit alerts! 
I would like for the credit bureaus present me with their evidence to the contrary!",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30328.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3214284
705,2018-12-18,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/, my Chase checking account was fraudulently charged for the amount of {$200.00}. The transaction took place at a grocery store an hour away from where I live and attend school. Whoever responsible for the transaction made a small purchase and paid a fee in order to get {$200.00} in cash back, taking almost all the money from my checking account. I have never made a purchase in the city where the transaction took place and my Chase debit card has never left my possession. The morning after I was awoken by several calls from the Chase fraud department alerting me of the potentially fraudulent activity. I immediately checked my account and found that a charge had occurred without my consent. I contacted Chase and began the process of getting a new card, new pin number, and my funds back. This process was simple enough, I received a new card in the mail and went to a branch to assign a new pin to my new card. Chase quickly returned my funds to my account and I assumed the situation had been resolved. I was extremely relieved to have my money back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, the money was taken back out of my account by Chase due to a "" claim reversal ''. I immediately contacted Chase and got in touch with their claims department. I was told that I would need to fax proof of my location on the day of the transaction, and in 3-5 business days my money would be returned to me. I attended both work and class on the day of the transaction however on short notice I was only able to get documentation from my employer that I was clocked in on XX/XX/XXXX an hour away from where the transaction took place. The following day I went into a Chase branch and spoke with a banker who faxed the documentation to the claims department. The banker spoke to the claims department about my case and told me that he did not see any reason I would not get my money back after providing proof. He was informative about the ways that my information could have been stolen and used without my consent. I was told to contact the claims department in 3-5 business days. In the following weeks I contacted the claims department multiple times. I have been told that my claim is being investigated by an outside office and that it is out of the hands of Chase themselves whether I get my money back. The validity of the fraudulent transaction was being investigated despite Chase first notifying me about activity that had been deemed suspicious by their standards. My claim has been denied multiple times despite providing the document from my employer. I finally asked the representative to please connect me with someone who could give me more information. I spoke with an Escalation specialist named XXXX who looked at my claim and made notes of the extra information I gave her. She then submitted the claim for investigation again, which took another 3 to 5 business days. This claim was denied also. I have pleaded with Chase to please give me my money back, I even offered to provide more proof of the location of myself and my mother whose account is connected to mine. I was told that more documentation would not be needed. Without the further documentation, the claim was submitted again and today I received a letter saying that my case was closed and could not be reopened again. I do not know what else to do. The absence of this money set me back tremendously with bills right before the holiday season. I am a student, I work as a server for tips and {$200.00} is sometimes all the money I can make in a whole week. I did not travel an hour away between work and school to a city where I have never purchased anything and pay a fee to get cash back from a grocery store when there is a Chase ATM right down the street from me. My family and I will be closing our Chase checking accounts soon because we no longer trust them with our money and other than consulting an attorney we do not know what else to do about this situation.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,KY,40356.0,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-18,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3103363

I planned on using this amount ( XXXX ) to pay credit cards off and mortgage payment, ; and also a lawyer for a divorce i an going though. 

I had stopped using this account last year due to excessive overdraft fees imposed by cap one. ( XXXX fees at XXXX each ). for XXXX check i thought I cashed already. I talked to cap one, but they would not remove only XXXX. So I did not use that account. Until this past week when I needed to deposit the check i got for the settlement. 

I had tried other banks, but it was too large. So i tried XXXX, and it took it. and it was put on hold as i expected it would be. Then within the next couple of days I showed {$5000.00} available. Then the next couple days I paid bills with the available amount. This was on XXXX - XXXX I paid XXXX different bills. and my XXXX that i held off until i got this check. 
After the weekend i had not noticed the balance changing. I thought maybe becasue iof the weekend that come this week they would start being paid. On Tuesday -* Wednesday, still no change. So i tried using the debit card for that account., it was declined. That wast the first time I really figured there was something was wrong. So i called XXXX XXXX. At first they told me everything looked good and should work. Then they took a closser look. They came back to me and said my account had been charged off? What? First i have heard? So ok whats the fix, it shows my full amount available.? and i have payments going thru? Then I was told the account was restricted? What? why? and how come I didn't know? and why did it accept my check and show available? Plus they deducted the amount for the overdraft from last year!! and I still have not access to my funds, and payments are not being returned for NSF, with associated fees!! f plus a mark on my credit score for being late. 
XXXX XXXX tells me the only thing they can do is to issued a paper check back minus the NSF fees. and that will take XXXX to XXXX business days. so i have to wait to make all of these other accounts right, pay my mortgage, etc oh yeah and EAT! Now i have no money and i am out the fees they had already charged off. over {$250.00}. I asked them to open a new account and put money into that. Nope cant do that, have to send a check that is it. no matter who i spoke to, cold, uncaring and reverted back to fine print policy. over and over., I am so frustrated and angry at what they have done to me. and I am just supposed to sit here and be good with all of it. No. They have been unfair to m, e as a consumer. that check should have never been accepted in the first place. especially if it had been charged off, but not closed? And then proceed to show the amount available with a little green dot next to my debit card showing it was all good to go. 

This cant be right? I asked them if they are going to pay for al lof the fees that will ge the results of this. yeah right. Thats it. I am sitting here waiting on a check so i can try and right this ship/. but Cap One should not be able to do this to a consumer. and then basically tell you tough luck, nothing you can do about it!! this is so wrong. I am at my wits end dealing with this and all of the phone calls now coming from the returned payments! Plus with the divorce i am having to XXXX   my house to pay off my soon to be ex her portion of the house to finalize the divorce. now with this, my current mortgage payment will be late and affect my credit score and possibly nixing my refi chances and that opens up a whole other can of financial mess..

I would like it to be noted that throughout this 15 years we had spotty service, sometimes going days with no service. Reporting these outages did no good to either alleviate the issue or to be compensated for the time I was without internet service. 

XX/XX/XXXX a service tech came to my home to troubleshoot and fix the problems with the internet service that XXXX was unable to fix over the phone. At that appointment the tech told us that we needed a new modem because the one they had provided was no longer working. My son had a modem he was not using at the time and we opted to use my sons rather than use one that XXXX would provide for us for a fee. The tech took the used modem with him. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to stop service because we were moving to another town. Our move-in day was XX/XX/XXXX, I asked them to stop service on or before that date.The customer support person told me it was perfect timing because the billing cycle would close that day so we would get one final bill for the last month of service. To my knowledge, the service was stopped, I do not know for sure as we moved from the home in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In late XX/XX/XXXX I received a bill in the mail from XXXX for what I thought would be the last month of service. We paid roughly {$100.00} each month. When I went to pay online as I always have, the amount online was different than the amount of the bill. Online the balance due was {$230.00}. Upon looking closer at the bill the service period is for XXXX we were not even living at that address at that time. 
I made a call to XXXX around the end of XXXX or first part of XXXX to find out what the other charges were from since I was not expecting them. I was told the charges were for a modem. I explained to the person what had happened and that the tech had taken the modem with him that day that he was at our home. I also told him that I had tried to pay for the part of the bill we did owe, which was for the last month of service, but that the website does not give you an option to choose your payment amount, you either pay the entire bill or none of it. The customer service person at XXXX told me that he would put in a request to his manager to void the modem charges. He let me know that someone would call me to let me know when this was done so that I could go online and pay the portion we owed. I asked him on that call if I could pay him the {$100.00} portion of the bill he said no that we would have to wait until the modem charges were removed. 

A couple of weeks go by and in XX/XX/XXXX my husband called XXXX to check on the progress. He was placed on hold for over 45 minutes and the call disconnected twice before he was able to talk to anyone. He told the person the same thing I did, that the modem was taken by the tech but we would like to pay for the last month of service. He was told no, to wait until someone called him and the modem was removed from our bill. He ws given escalation # XXXX. XXXX called back on XX/XX/XXXX and said that the information would be transgered for another department and they would call back. 

In a short time, XX/XX/XXXX, less than 60 days since I was billed, XXXX placed delinquent charges on to my credit. I immediately called the collection company and was told that the charges were for a modem and I could pay for it through them but that it would not erase the ding on my credit. I explained that we were working to resolve the issue with XXXX and that I was waiting for them to take the charges off of the bill to pay the remaining portion. The collections agent did not care to talk to me about my concerns, only stating that there was nothing I could do about the credit score going down. 

Because I work during the day, during business hours, and anytime we called them it was at least a 30 minute wait sometimes up to 2 hours and that most likely the system would end the call at least once during the time you were trying to make contact, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called XXXX and asked to speak to a manager. He was denied that request and told that he had to resolve his issue with the person that answered the phone. He explained the full situation. The person did not seem to understand and asked irrelevant questions getting him no where in the resolution of the problem. After much persistence he was finally transferred to a person in the collection department. Her name is XXXX and the case # she gave to reference is XXXX.. She told XXXX that the modem charges would not be removed until a ticket was put in that the modem was lost. He explained that our credit score had been affected and she stated that she understood but that putting in the ticket would trigger them to remove the charges so he could pay the rest of the bill and then everything would be ok after that. He once again asked to pay the amount we owed and was once again told to wait. He asked for her direct number since she seemed to be the only person either of us was able to talk to that seemed to understand and might actually do something. He was told to wait 3-4 days and he would hear back. If he did not hear back he was supposed to call XXXX back. XXXX asked for the womens direct line which she informed him she did not have a direct line. 

Over the course of several useless attempts to contact XXXX, mind you we both work and have limited time that we can be on personal calls, he was not able to reach anyone. He tried several times over several days, repeatedly being placed on hold and hung up on, he put his name on an automated waitlist for someone to call him back several times over a couple of days and no one ever called him. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I got another email, keep in mind that we had service shut off on XX/XX/XXXX, not even 90 days before this, I got another email from the credit alert company that I again had delinquent charges on my credit history. Upon looking at my credit the 2nd delinquent charges were from XXXX too, in the amount of {$100.00}! The amount we had been trying to pay! 

XXXX once again called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX he was hung up on twice during a period of time between XXXX as he would call, be placed on hold, be put on the call list, wait for them to call back, this happened repeatedly until he could not stay by the phone any longer for the day having already spent 6 hours trying to get through to someone. 

Even though it infuriates me to say, we know we owe {$100.00} and we will willingly pay it as weve been saying all along and practically begging for XXXX to take. However, I have worked very hard to get the credit score I had. I take my credit very seriously and it was decreased by over 50 points. The way XXXX divided up the charges made two incidents on my credit appear. We have tried over and over to work with XXXX and the collections company even offering to pay the full amount if theyll take off the bad marks from our credit. XXXX been told there is nothing that can be done. It is XX/XX/XXXX still not even 90 days from when we had our service shut off with XXXX and were billed for a service period that was for after we sold the house. I want my credit rating returned to what it was prior to XXXX causing this nightmare situation.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,R & B Corporation of Virginia,KS,66071.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3403821

788,2020-03-11,Credit card or prepaid card,Government benefit card,Unexpected or other fees,,"I would like to express my concern on behalf of my mother. I am her Power of attorney and sole care provider. I am in desperate need of assistance. I have been trying to get this resolved since XX/XX/XXXX. I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone with your company and each time, Im finding that I am getting nothing resolved. 

My mother is a XXXX year old widow. Who is 100 percent XXXX. She has XXXX XXXX, XXXX  and is XXXX XXXX She is not mobile due to her condition. She is depressed and frustrated during this process. It is an inconvenience for her to travel or deal with her own personal business matters. This is why I am appointed to do this for her. I am very disappointed with the way her situation is being handled. I am in disbelief in how unprofessional this company has been from the beginning and I am taken back that elderly consumers can be taken advantage of. 

Normally, my mother makes transfers two to three times a year from her Direct Express account to her personal XXXX XXXX account. This is where our issue begins with your company. 

XX/XX/XXXX-My mother and I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX., XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ca XXXX. I had to take time out of my day with my kids to transport her in her wheelchair. We attempted to transfer the amount of {$2000.00}. Prior occasions the transfer amounts were {$4000.00}, sometimes more. We went to the teller and he explained to me that we couldnt swipe the card again for this transaction because it was declined. However, if we needed a minimal amount that day we can use the ATM machine. We were advised we needed to wait one whole business day. Per their policy. We continued to follow through with withdrawing funds this time trying to get {$200.00}. At this point we realized there was something terribly wrong. If a minimal withdrawal of {$200.00} was declined, then there was a HUGE problem because this account should have over the amount requested. Once the transaction was complete, we were notified that this transaction was also denied. 

At XXXX the same day, we went home to contact direct express. I attempted to call. When doing so, the automated system made us aware of the account balance of {$100.00}. Then the automated message stated there is a High call volume. Then, I was disconnected from the call. I asked my mom if she had an online account set up. She is elderly and is not computer savvy. So, she wouldnt have the first clue on how to set up an online account. With her permission she assisted me in creating one for her on this day. After we attempted to set up an online account. The website would not allow me to create a new account due to one was already established. We panicked because we were not the ones created this online account. Frustrated and lost, I saw on direct expresss website that you can download an app. I did that, and created an account through the app. And this is where we discovered all the fraudulent charges from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I was able to review some transactions. At that point there were pending charges, and we cancelled the card. 

Around XXXX the same day, I attempted to call Direct Express again. I do not recall the representatives name that I spoke with due to being on my cell phone with the Merchant from XXXX XXXX  at the same time. I spoke to a representative name XXXX from accounting who told me that XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX is who booked the hotel and charged the room. There were numerous charges to this hotel. I told the representative from direct express the situation, while trying to explain the same thing to the merchant. I was in tears at this point. The representative apologized for what was happening and said they would transfer me to the fraud department. I spoke with someone in fraud. We combed through 25 transactions. We got to the 25th transaction and I told the rep my phone was running out of battery and requested that he call me back on my cell phone. Before I could give him the cell number, my phone died. He kept insisting he was going to call me back and he never did. I tried to call back again was irritated at this point because because I did not have a new card to input into your system to get to a Customer Service Rep. I had to wait another week and a half to get a replacement card. Your system would not allow me to speak with a live person without a card number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received the card by mail ( card ending XXXX ). My mother activated it. We proceeded to try to get in contact with your company. To Re-explain the situation. This time I came in contact with a VERY rude individual. I was so upset I didnt even get her name. She put me on hold for about 50 minutes. I talked to a nice lady in the fraud department and she put me on hold so that she can document all the fraudulent charges. She was so polite and kept checking in on me, due to how long I was holding. She explained to me that there we NUMEROUS fraudulent charges. She advised me of the process. I would be receiving a letter in the mail shortly. The transactions needed to be written down for dispute. I can either mail documentation in, or fax it all in. She told me fax would be more convenient and quicker. They planned to do a provisional credit to my mothers account in the incorrect amount of {$24000.00}. Less than 24 hours later they reversed the credit. I called them again, questioning them on what took place. My mother was really upset because she thought this nightmare was over. And we continued to get the run around. I received a letter in the mail saying that there was conflict found during their investigation. They were unable to confirm fraudulent activity. This is incorrect. They tried to accuse me of having access of this card. This was VERY offensive to me. This card never left my mothers purse. I care for my mother 24 hours a day. I have XXXX kids and a XXXX  of my own. We do not travel. Period. It is pretty obvious that a XXXX year old lady didnt XXXX to XXXX to charge her direct express account. Also, there were charges to a prison, and random charges that could not possibly be made by my Elderly mother. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a police report with the XXXX Sherriffs station. The report was filed with Deputy XXXX. Report XXXX for grand theft ( fraud ). I was called once from the Deputy. I tried to reach them back and was not able to reach anyone since. 


XX/XX/XXXX another attempt to get this resolved. I got in contact with XXXX, who said he did not have a direct line but had a badge number XXXX. I was on hold for 45 minutes this time. XXXX was really helpful. He explained to me that the dispute was denied because the month of XXXX was not included in the documentation that I submitted. I sent in 16 pages with the dispute and it included every single fraudulent transaction. XXXX and I, once again combed through the transactions. He told me that the fraud department denied the claim because there was a notation that a in person transaction took place. While going through the statements he agreed that there were no in person transactions. He was puzzled and taken back. He told me that once a case is denied we can not appeal the decision. However, since XXXX was not included, he told us to try to re-submit for XXXX and they can possibly re-open the prior decision. Which, I realize was something he said to get me off the phone. He promised me that he would mail me paperwork for XXXX dispute. I have to this date, not received anything. He even told me that I needed to contact each merchant and investigate this on my own. As if I didnt have a life of my own to tend to. I begged him to give me a LIVE person to speak to in the fraud department. He said there was no one we can talk to. I asked if we could speak to the individual who denied the case. He continued to tell me there was no one. So, I asked for his supervisor, or anyone above him to assist me. He said that they would call me in the next few days. To this date, I have never received a call from XXXX supervisor. I never received a call from the Fraud department. 

My next step was to contact my congressman. I came in contact with the receptionist. They advised me that someone would call me in 2 days. If I didnt hear from them in two days. Keep trying. Still no response. Still getting absolutely no where. And no one cares! 

I was instructed to contact Federal Trade commission, I filed a complaint online with them on XX/XX/XXXX. On the same day we called XXXX to place a block and alert her report. From here, I was instructed to contact Consumer Financial Bureau. I got in touch with XXXX. XXXX was amazing and stated that its obvious fraud and gave me the steps to follow on filing a complaint. This is where I am today. 

During this WHOLE process we discovered that {$34000.00} was fraudulently stolen from my mother vs {$24000.00} that we originally from the beginning. Old Card number used for fraudulent activity is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Im just trying to understand why this was allowed? How can your company get away with this? Will it take me going to the media to get this resolved? My mother was a XXXX XXXX for 30 years. Her hard earned money was taken from her. You neglected to protect her funds. Any legal establishment would have let us know about large amounts being charged. Why didnt anyone stop this? PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS RESOLVED! Thank you in advance for all of your help. Please contact me if you have any further questions. I will attach any documentation requested. 

*******IF YOU REVIEW STATEMENTS YOU WILL FIND THAT MY MOTHER ONLY MAKES A FEW TRANSFERS A YEAR. IN XXXX SHE MADE ONLY TWO TRANSFERS. THEN FROM XXXX TO XXXX YOU WILL SEE RANDOM CHARGES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE MADE BY HER******* PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS- IT'S OBVIOUS OF FRAUD.",,Comerica,CA,93551.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3562061

797,2019-07-01,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/19, I purchased {$1100.00} in XXXX XXXX gift cards from XXXX These gift cards were used to book a flight on XX/XX/XXXX ; the email confirmation for this reservation, sent on the same day, clearly reflect the gift card numbers purchased from XXXX as the method pf payment ( s ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received notice that the booking was returned to the cardholder and a new form of payment was needed as the ticket ( s ) status is SUSPENDED. 

I initiated a dispute with Discover about the transaction around XX/XX/XXXX. The case number for that dispute being XXXX. 

I was given a credit for the amount in dispute, but found out this was reversed on XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was informed XXXX had provided sufficient evidence. This was a scan containing the gift card numbers they supplied me. 

I tried reasoning, saying why would I need to pay for the same flight if the gift cards were valid? I stated they ( Discover ) would see another transaction, this time from XXXX themselves, for the flight, as a charge. And I did have to charge the flight, the purchase occurring on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, at the terminal. I also uploaded this itinerary, showing the same flight number, dates, passengers, destination, etc as matching the original made on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was informed by someone at Discover, perhaps XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke with so many people at so many different times trying to get this resolved the exact date eludes me ) that if I could get it in writing from XXXX that the gift cards were fraudulent, that would really help my cause. 

I submitted in writing that request to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a response until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, and it was vague at best, stating the reservation had been canceled due to a dispute that was filed against the purchase. 

This was not sufficient for Discover. 

I then got it in writing, from XXXX after filing a XXXX complaint against XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, stating the following : "" ... in reviewing our records, I found that the XXXX gift cards ( listed below ) that you mentioned acquiring from XXXX were purchased through unauthorized activity. 
XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} Once this was brought to our attention, all reservations associated with the gift cards were canceled, and the money was returned to the credit cards used to purchase these cards from XXXX XXXX initially. We regret that this resulted in the cancellation of your, XXXX, and XXXX reservation. Although I was glad to see we honored the original fare, were sorry for your disappointment with having to rebook and pay for your familys reservation upon arrival to the airport. 

Please keep in mind that XXXX XXXX is not responsible for honoring invalid gift cards or refunding any additional funds applied to the reservation. With that in mind, the funds applied from the two additional XXXX gift cards ( listed below ) arent available for use or eligible for a refund. 
XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} I called Discover on XX/XX/XXXX, telling them of the new information. 

The lady with whom I spoke, XXXX ( sp? ), stated that the case is closed, and they ( Discover ) would not take it up any further. 

I stated that this is new information and that my dispute center on discover.com states ( EMPHASIS MINE ) We have finished our second review of this investigation. Based on information we received from both you and the merchant, the transaction appears to be valid. We sent you a letter via mail or secure message at Discover.com about this investigation which includes a copy of documentation we reviewed. Please review this information and notify us immediately if you wish to continue this dispute. IF YOU HAVE NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED, WE WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON YOUR BEHALF. 

I asked how Discover could possibly side with XXXX when they ( Discover ) have it in black and white that I was sold a bill of goods. 

The answer to this, and every other question I asked of them, was that the case is closed and they ( Discover ) would not take it up any further. And that I should try to resolve this with XXXX. That Discover is ( paraphrasing ) done with the matter unless they get it in writing from XXXX that a refund is owed to me.

829,2019-02-25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I transferred by federal student loans over to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX in order to participate in their public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ). I had been making on-time, qualifying payments ( at least the minimum amount due, income-based repayments ) through my previous loan provider, XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX ( it may have been a different provider originally, but XXXX has been my main loan provider for the last several years ). Since transferring my loans over to XXXX XXXX XXXX, they validated my employer/job as eligible for the program. According to the details of the PSLF program, I should be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX, after working for 10 years in a XXXX/XXXX XXXX position and having made 120 qualifying payments ). 
However, they have miscalculated the number of my qualifying payments I have made, despite repeated calls to customer service about this issue. Each time I call, I am told that they need more time in order to appropriately calculate my payments ( I am typically told 6-8 weeks ). Currently, my account shows that I have made 17 qualifying payments on my Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan, thus indicating I have 103 more qualifying payments to make, indicating I would be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX! It also indicates I have only made 24 qualifying payments on my Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan, which indicates I have 96 more qualifying payments to make. I have made consistent, on-time, full minimum amount due payments since consolidating my loans in XX/XX/XXXX. Each time I call in order to address this significant issue, I feel as though I am being given the "" run-around '' so-to-speak. I was initially informed that a computer calculates the qualifying payments through my previous loan provider, and then told that an actual person needs to go through and properly calculate the payments if the computer does not do them properly. I was told this would take 6-8 weeks, each time I've called. 
I have contacted Fed Loan Servicing, and specifically the PSLF department 4 times now. I called initially on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them my payments were miscalculated. I was assured this would be resolved within 6-8 weeks. I  called again XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that a Payment Tracking Review Form would be submitted to their accounting/payment department in order for a human to individually calculate my qualifying payments with my past provider ( XXXX ). I called again XX/XX/XXXX to follow up, and again was informed it would take 6-8 more weeks. I called again most recently on XX/XX/XXXX and I spoke to a customer service representative ( XXXX ID # XXXX ) and eventually a Service Delivery Team Member. ( XXXX ID # XXXX ). I was informed that it is now taking One year plus to complete payment reviews. I have never previously been informed of this, and XXXX informed me that we stopped giving people timeframes in XX/XX/XXXX so the person I spoke to in XX/XX/XXXX must have made a mistake ( mind you, I was given a 6-8 week time frame by multiple customer service representatives, as well as different information each time I called ). 
XXXX looked into my Payment Tracking Review, and informed me my payment review is still pending. What pending meant, according to her, is that someone has looked at my payment histories, and was still reviewing it to determine the number of qualifying payments. I informed her that I should be scheduled to be complete with my loan forgiveness next year in XX/XX/XXXX; I asked if there was any way my account could be expedited, given had I known it was going to take this long to review my qualifying payments, I would have requested a Payment Review Tracking form much sooner than I had ( for example, in XX/XX/XXXX when I initially called to alert them of the miscalculated payments ). She informed me this was not likely, given the number of customers they have and the number of individuals reviewing my particular case ; it was impossible to tell just where in the process they were. She informed me that 28 pending payments of mine were being reviewed currently. ( I have made many more than this ). She also informed me that between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX my payments did not appear to qualify because I did not pay the agreed upon amount. She said, and I quote, You paid more than the minimum amount which means those payment were placed in something called Paid ahead status and thus did not qualify as a qualifying payment towards the loan forgiveness. She informed me that given I paid MORE than the minimum amount during this period, the qualification could be changed, but it was unclear when/how this could occur. I was also informed that there were 4 forbearance timeframes where my payments did not count. I informed her I did file forbearances during tax season in order to get my taxes done prior to paying the updated amount for the year ( since it is an income-based repayment, it requires our taxes are completed to calculate the amounts ). However, I still made the minimum payment during that time anyway. She reported that Fed Loan could move or cut forbearance because payments were made, but again, it was not clear when/how this would occur. 
XXXX also informed me that applications for individuals who are in their 10th year of service ( thus completing their required payments/terms of services ) are reviewed first and given priority for properly calculating payments. She indicated that as I get closer to the end of my service ( In XX/XX/XXXX ), that I would have a better likelihood of having my final payments calculated properly ( if not by XX/XX/XXXX or later ). 
I was informed that I would be notified by mail when this process is complete, which likely would not be until XX/XX/XXXX ( at the earliest ) but also likely later, despite the fact that I originally transferred my loans over to them XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, I informed her that my 2 loans are showing different qualifying payments when they should be the same ( as theyre consolidated so one payment goes to both loans ). She reported that is a common issue they were looking into for many borrowers. 
Currently, XXXX XXXX XXXX is the only provider approved by the Federal government/Department of Education to manage loans for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This is the SOLE reason I transferred my loans to them, despite having heard similar complaints to mine from others. The fact that borrowers are being given different, and misleading information regarding their qualifying payments, and that now we are being told it will take over ONE YEAR to figure this out, seems fraudulent to me. Were it not for this program, borrowers may have chosen to remain with their prior lender/loan provider, or sought out a different one to manage their loans. It seems to be they are engaging in predatory practices by essentially forcing borrowers to use them for loan servicing in order to qualify for PSLF, however the method and process by which they determine eligibility appears to be mystifying at best, fraudulent at worst. In the meantime, they are collecting large amounts of interest on my outstanding loans, and apparently I can be punished if I pay an amount ABOVE my minimum payment amount. This keeps borrowers in a vicious cycle of being at the loan providers mercy in the meantime, all the while with no promise or guarantee of loan forgiveness, despite having followed and met criteria for fulling PSLF obligations.

In the end what they did was damage my credit even more to the point of sending out fraudulent letter stating I am dispute the validity of all my accounts. This caused fraud alerts on everyone of my open accounts and also caused one account to be closed. 

I have emails from a rep from them stating that they would fix everything and even the manager who said that this never should of happened and that he would fix it as well and then continued to send out these fraudulent letters claiming I was disputing all my accounts. 

I contacted a legal service who stated that it is illegal for a company to obtain a fee for credit services in the state of New York, prior to the services being completed. I paid them a total of {$1200.00}. I have requested a refund and the legal service has as well and they have ignored all requests. 

I believe that, Credit Mount has violated 15 U.S. Code 1679b.  Prohibited practices, and I am looking for action to be taken against them. They have caused irreparable damage to my credit and I also want a FULL refund!!

865,2018-12-11,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"XX/XX/XXXX I was called by XXXX XXXX and informed that money was owed by me and I had very little time to pay it back or be forced out of school. When I inquired about the money or why I was being charged the once helpful demeanor was met with standoffish and unhelpful from everyone involved. I was no longer being provided with answers when I asked questions and it became very clear due to fear of legal repercussions they weren't going to inform me of anything aside from the money owed. Furthermore, due to XXXX XXXX XXXX habit of charging per semester instead of per class ( there are three or four classes per semester ) I was trapped inside a semester I couldn't pay for. My understanding was that, I owed money for an undisclosed reason and couldn't continue going to school however I was still pushed into the following semester. I felt I was trapped, as so the school could continue to charge me. 
I faced an emergency and when I asked my instructor he looked at me lost and said he didn't know. I went back and forth between him and administrator as they argued to see who would be responsible for my absence. 
Skipping to this year. In XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by debt collection agency who informed me of a XXXX dollar owed to the university. My understanding is : the money that the University is claiming I owe, is coming from the money they had to refund back to the government, and to themselves ( They offered me a scholarship ). I'm being asked to pay for services I was never given. The school itself claims the original sum -- which forced me out -- from a class I was to retake. Unless my memory is faulty the emergency that resulted in a missed class I spoke with admin and brought along hospital papers to prove my stay in the emergency room. The other incident I can recall that may have forced me to retake a class mentioned above and I thought excused. I can not recall any other time I would have needed to retake a class that would require a retake fee prior to XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. There was also never any mention when I spoke to admin that I would be charged during these events as far as I can recall. 
In closing, I spoke with the debt collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked them to provide paper work ( bill, account summary, paper work, etc. ) to show to legal console for advice on this matter. The paper work I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX states account balance of XXXX dollars, to make sure it wasn't an error on their part I reached out to XXXX  XXXX  and got a Student Account Summary and can confirm Acct.

931,2019-02-18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX2018 I booked an online trip to XXXX with 5 star hotels to take place in XX/XX/XXXX2018.  The booking was made with an online travel agent known as XXXX. I made an online payment of a deposit of {$5000.00} to the "" online agent '' to be paid to the hotels specified for specified dates. I used my American Express Platinum Card for this transaction. The terms were "" 100 % refundable if cancelled more than 90 days in advance of the trip ''. I was advised that all bookings were confirmed in XXXX by this "" agent '' and deposits made. 

In XX/XX/XXXX 2018 I received a call from another travel agent who said some of the hotels were not available for the dates agreed. I was confused by this as the bookings had supposedly been confirmed in XX/XX/XXXX2018. I immediately contacted all the other hotels and upon checking with the hotels, I discovered nothing had been booked in my name or by/on behalf of this agent for me. I researched online and found many fraud warnings and reports that this "" agent '' was an online fraudulent operation, with rip-off reports files, consumer complaints, stories of theft and fraud. I immediately sent a request to cancel this trip to this "" agent '' and demand a full refund since this was over 90 days before the "" trip '' ( 180 days in fact ). The agent kept reassuring me that they would refund me "" ONCE THEY RECEIVED THE REFUND FROM THE XXXX XXXX XXXX HOTELS ''. They produced phony receipts and fraudulent booking confirmations that the hotels have assured me were fake. I have confirmation from XXXX XXXX XXXX hotels that there were no payments or bookings made in my name by or on behalf of this "" agent ''. ATTACHED- EMAILS FROM THE HOTELS. 

Once I realized that this was a fraudulent operation with no legitimacy, I reported the fraud to American Express. I found out that this merchant seems to be operating online by selling "" tours '' using the name of a legitimate franchise to advertise, but not being a legitimate franchisee. This operation has no legitimate business address except online, and their payment information and operating name is in fact different from the franchise name they use online to trap the unsuspecting public or consumer. Instead of American Express investigating the fraud, they advised me that once I had given my credit card number out to a merchant, it was not a fraud, but was a "" dispute '' and the merchant was the one who had the benefit of the doubt. The merchant produced phony bookings that did not refer to me ( my  name was nowhere on the documentation ), and the merchant produced a new set of terms not connected to their website, trying to exclude my weeks of travel from the cancellable clause online ( all documentation was sent to American Express ) yet American Express still did not reverse the charge. I sent American Express written confirmation from the hotel groups that these bookings were not legitimate and never made by this alleged agent, and no payments were ever received by these hotel groups from this merchant. American Express is obliged to protect the consumer/customer for goods and services not received. American Express initially reversed this charge in my favor, yet have rebilled me. I reopened the dispute and sent them the full information again, yet they rebilled me again without any regard for the evidence produced. I reported this as fraud again and they once again sent it to the disputed department. Each time, they credited the account and then reversed the charge and rebilled me. This has been going on from XX/XX/XXXX 2018 until XX/XX/XXXX 2019, when I again received a letter advising me that we would be rebilled the {$5000.00}. There is no other choice for us than to file this complaint. We are Platinum Card holders and pay a hefty annual fee to American Express, yet they have been very remiss in the way that this has been handled. 
The terms I signed were cancellable if, using my American Express Platinum Card., using my American Express Platinum Card .

Terms signed were fully cancellable if over 90 days notice. 
Merchant did not provide the services at all. 
Merchant has unlawfully kept the payment instead of refunding us, despite promising that they would do so.

As we paid this mortgage loan off on XX/XX/2019 to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and received payoff figures, all proper documents, liens and title, XXXX XXXX is still sending invoices that are due and very inconsistent with letters from mr Cooper saying XXXX paid them for our loan. Don't know how each handled but we just handled as told per letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/2019. I am forwarding a copy from XXXX stating our loan did not begin until XX/XX/2019 ( by separate fax to XXXX ). Therefore, I did not have a mortgage loan with mr Cooper and they had no right to send anything to credit bureaus and we were never late with any such payments to them per information received from XXXX. I wish to get all this confusion done with since it is causing much stress in our lives. Therefore, we were not late paying this mortgage at all and should have not been put through any of this upset and intolerable confusion. I would also ask that when takeovers happen, the consumer have a right to decide who they want their mortgage company to be with instead of takeovers such as this.

1014,2020-03-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"We are already current customers of this Suntrust/Truist, and our 1st mortgage is already with this same bank on our current home. I inherited a new property free and clear ( from my grandpa ) and it is currently is rented ( no mortgage ). I was taking applying for a mortgage on this property XXXX and placing this money toward my current primary home. ( I have a second mortgage with XXXX, XXXX. We are paying this off, placing the additional XXXX on or current 1st mortgage and then refi to lower percentage on the lower equity ). My current home was appraised at I think XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, when I first obtained the mortgage with Suntrust. Suntrust was even using this same appraisal ( from XX/XX/XXXX ) for this process. So there were many moving pieces to this puzzle. In the end were also planning to have an equity line on the rest of equity in our home. ... End result Suntrust to have close to XXXX XXXX in mortgages. 

Again current customer, not been late on my mortgage which we already have with Suntrust. This process of the loan app, started XX/XX/XXXX, by XX/XX/XXXX, I still did not have a closing date on anything-2 months. I will attach documentation to show. I even had many conference calls pertaining to the long delays and the endless paper work they were requesting. 

A couple points I want to make : We are a small business ( open 25 years ) Due to this fact I am well aware there will be additional paperwork ( tax returns and more bank statements ) We have been embezzled back in XXXX over XXXX ( during the course of a couple years ). She was stealing our payroll taxes, unknown to us and this caused us to have make an arrangement with the IRS ( XXXX ) per month. FBI investigation, she went to XXXX for XXXX XXXX  was XXXX with XXXX count of XXXX XXXX XXXX. We receive {$42.00} per month as restitution. I advised the bank of this the first time we obtained the mortgage and again during this process. I forwarded all IRS and FBI paper work before it was requested. I am not telling you this for sympathy, however I was scrutinized due to this situation, which again was in XXXX! Also NONE OF THIS PREVENTED ME FROM OBTAINING THE MORTGAGE TO BEGIN WITH! SO WHY NOW? 

It did not mater what documentation I submitted to Suntrust and how much patience I gave. I had conference calls with processors, their managers, their "" Exception '' managers? Suntrust at the end was requesting proof my $ XXXX/business payment arrangement ( again started in XXXX or XXXX ) was current. When you have an auto debit set up with the IRS they only give you a yearly statement ( not monthly ) and there are no business transcripts you can pull only personal ones with IRS. I signed 2 different 4506-T to give access to all our personal transcripts as well as pulled them myself and sent them. I forwarded my IRS yearly statement I receive every XXXX, along with proof of these {$500.00} payments clearing after XX/XX/XXXX ( bank statement/report ) since it was over six months ago I had received this YEARLY STMNT from the IRS-SHOWING ALL CURRENT. I OWED NO OUTSTANDING MONEY TO IRS, NO LIENS. 

I finally called off Suntrust XX/XX/XXXX. I advised them i would not want to give them my business after countless phone calls and emails. I will be moving my account and loans. I was clearly discriminated against, because there is not one reason I should have been ridiculed by my own bank, with properties I already own.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,VA,23452.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3581711

I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. 

She advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. 

With this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month  extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. 

If this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills.

The new balance for XXXX was {$4300.00} with a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2500.00} that is not showing on this statement because no payments were showing but I paid the {$2500.00} before the due date. I did not pay this month in full and accrued interest of {$45.00} which I do not debate. Then in XXXX my amount owed was {$370.00} with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I paid XX/XX/XXXX {$130.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2500.00} and XX/XX/XXXX {$5700.00}. I paid all purchases besides the pending purchases which were the {$370.00} before the credit card close date.

SSN XXXX I recently had an informative phone conversation with a representative of NAVIENT and was explained why I had late payments reported on my credit score. Back in XXXX of 2018, I requested a forbearance due to hurricane Irma, due to the short time working at my new job and I also learned during the phone conversation with the representative that my monthly payments would be more than $ 300 monthly. I had every intention to start making payments on my student loans in this 2018 year. Earlier in the year I was requesting for my payments to be {$100.00} but I was told the minimum based on my household size and income would be more than $ 300 monthly. At that time I was not able to pay that amount monthly and I told them I could only afford {$100.00} or less. 
Early XXXX I had a death in the family, my grandfather. On XX/XX/2018, two days after coming back from out of the country due to a death in my family, I received an alert in my email that 22 accounts were reported delinquent. As a result, the late payment was reported to my credit score. 
Multiple attempts were made to get in touch with me especially through email however I had forgotten that two years ago, I selected email as my preference for contact and that now I have a new email address that needed to be updated. And that was another reason why I was not expecting mails as well. As soon as I got back in the United States, I attempted to call on a XXXX morning but the office was closed. I attempted again but it was a holiday and by the next day it was already too late. After the delinquency was reported to my credit, I reached out to another representative. I was then informed that my payments were $ XXXX monthly and that it was also {$90.00} and not more than {$300.00}. I told the representative had I known I would have not filed forbearance earlier in the year and I would have already started making the $ XXXX monthly payments. The representative apologized and gave me another forbearance due to misinformation and miscommunication, she had her manager looked at my account to confirm the new monthly of {$90.00}. The payments are set to begin in XXXX 2018. 
I realize that this was not completely a mistake made by NAVIENT ; but rather, a mistake on my end for not remembering the forbearance end date and for not following up to make sure all of my information on file was up to date and accurate. However, after seeking some advice on how to go about the situation, I was informed that creditors, such as NAVIENT have discretion to remove negative reports in certain instances. 
I am not proud of this black mark on my record. I would be extremely grateful if you could honor this request to remove the lateness from my credit report. I am fully committed to maintaining prompt payments and I am open to enrolling in auto-payments if such an option would help with the requested removal. It would help me immensely in securing other lines of credit so that I can further improve my credit score. 
If the lateness can not be removed entirely, I would still be appreciative if you could make a goodwill adjustment. 
Thank You.

1098,2019-07-13,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I had a minimum payment of {$27.00} due on XX/XX/2019. I paid {$27.00} via my online account, deducting from my checking account on XX/XX/2019. This {$27.00} payment cleared my bank on XX/XX/2019. I verified with my bank that the funds had been paid out. I logged into my credit account online to check my available credit on XX/XX/2019. The payment was still pending due to it being the weekend and not a weekly business day. I called card services and spoke with a representative who explained this to me and advised me that the payment would reflect on that following Monday, XX/XX/2019. Once this happened, my available credit limit would update. I logged into my credit account online again on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 and the {$27.00} e-payment does reflect as being paid on XX/XX/2019. However, my available credit limit had not changed. I contacted card services again on XX/XX/2019 and spoke first with a representative and then a supervisor. Both of these individuals told me that the {$27.00} payment had been received but had not yet been posted. The explanation provided to me was that, because several months prior a payment was returned, and therefore this current payment would not be posted to my account until I gave them permission to contact my bank directly. ( The returned payment was resolved within days of the first returned payment. I also paid the fee due to that occurrence. ) I refused to do so because I felt they had no right to contact my bank to discuss my personal bank account. The supervisor I spoke with stated that unless I allowed them to do so, the payment would not be posted to my account. She stated that the payment may eventually post, at least 14 days from that date, XX/XX/2019. 

I reviewed the credit card agreement online which states : "" You agree to pay us in United States dollars. If you pay by check, your check must be drawn on a depository institution located in the United States. If you do not pay the New Balance in full, you agree to pay by your Payment Due Date at least the Minimum Payment Due. You may, at any time, pay the total amount owing on your Account. Payments are posted to your Account in a timely manner as required by law. However, we may delay restoring your available Credit Limit in the amount of the payment to make sure we receive the funds. '' I contacted my bank again to inquire about the credit card company 's demands to have access to discussing my bank account. The bank representative stated that this rarely occurs, only on a 3-way phone call, and that she personally had never heard of it happening for a {$27.00} payment. 

My concern is not only with the questionable delay in posting my payment, which both my bank and the credit card company acknowledge to have been cleared, but also with the fact that the agreement does not put a specific number of days regarding "" ... delay restoring your available credit limit ... '' Seemingly, they could delay this restoration for as long as they want. That is extremely worrisome to me. 

I have continued in refusing the credit card company to contact my bank ; to threaten me by stating they will not post the payment unless I give them this permission is absurd. I don't know what else to do with this problem. It has become a much larger issue than just the {$27.00} at this point.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,IA,52240.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3305583

My daughter XXXX XXXX XXXX was a matriculated student  at XXXX University from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX graduating with a XXXX Degree. Her Student Loan package included XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX Key Bank Student Loans and XXXX University Loans. The XXXX Key Bank Student Loan ( XXXX ) is the object of my complaint. 
XXXX died on XX/XX/XXXX from a rare form of XXXX XXXX. This was an act of god not a preventable self inflicted happenstance. She continued to work following her diagnosis in the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX she had completed her XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX University. She was a dedicated XXXX for her entire career and studied steadfastly to become a successful professional in her chosen field of XXXX XXXX culminating in her last position as the XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Virginia. While there she made her mark as a professional in her field through XXXX XXXX XXXX and implementation for endangered species including the XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX etc. As XXXX XXXXr she taught XXXX   skills to students and staff as well as coordinating research efforts with many national and international XXXX. 
CHRONOLOGY A chronology of the educational challenges of this very bright person coming from a lower middle class family started with her acceptance to XXXX University in XXXX, NY on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment provided a summary estimate of Costs and Resources of attending XXXX and of the awarded financial aid ( See Attachment # 13 ). On XX/XX/XXXX ( See Attachment # 1 ) we received a letter awarding the XXXX Key Bank Alternative Loan with instructions to fill out and return the application to Key Bank. The letter goes on to state that once the application is received by Key Bank the fall portion of the loan would appear on the XXXX XXXX Statement. And if the application is not received byXX/XX/XXXX the aid amount would not appear on the XX/XX/XXXX statement and that You would be responsible for the fall portion of the loan. It does not state if the loan is denied it merely states if the application is not received. Indeed the Instructions ( See Attachment # 2 ) in the loan packet state who is eligible ... to wit : a US Citizen/National, permanent resident, or eligible non-citizen. If you are an eligible noncitizen or permanent resident you must have a cosigner for the XXXX Key Alternative Loan is is a U.S. Citizen/National or permanent resident. The packet included an application for the XXXX  loan, XXXX application Instructions and promotional literature about the benefits of the XXXX. The brochure ( See Attachments # 3 & # 11 ) highlighted the following : - Low cost - Student is the borrower - No payments until after graduation - Graduate eligibility - Cosigner Release Option - 4.00 % with cosigner and 9.00 % without a cosigner As well as numerous other benefits extoling the virtues of the XXXX After being declined for the XXXX   initially ( XXXX XXXX ) due to No Credit History or Insufficient Credit History, we were encouraged to appeal the refusal on XX/XX/XXXX we were informed that additional information was required including Cosigner and borrower references. The loan was approved in the nick of time ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as classes had already started. The XXXX Application Instructions indicate a cosigner is needed if you are not a US Citizen. Since XXXX was clearly a US Citizen she had been denied the loan for other the reasons noted above. If Credit History or insufficient Credit History were the rationale for denying the loan I would postulate that the majority of College Freshmen do not have a Credit History upon which to develop creditworthiness. This seems to be a clear case of Bait and Switch as a tactic to ensnare freshman students and their parents into long term debt contracts and could be construed as predatory lending especially since there is a third party XXXX U. proffering awards of financial aid. The third party in this case created the financial aid package which allow the student to attend this institution of higher learning and allow the lender to offer a product upon XXXX letterhead as well as facilitation. 
A similar XXXX scenario occurred during the XX/XX/XXXX-XXXX  term when the application for the XXXX was rejected initially despite my being the cosigner. All of a sudden the loan was actually approved and XXXX was being provided the financial assistance she needed to pursue her education. It should be noted that the XXXX was renewable each year as documented in the Promissory Note ( see Attachments # 5 & # 8 ). Before graduating XXXX XXXX had accumulated 5 XXXX Key Bank Alternative Loans ( see Attachment # 7 ) totaling {$23000.00}. 
Following graduation in XX/XX/XXXX and a six month deferment period, XXXX began payments ( See Attachment # 7 ) on XX/XX/XXXX through the XXXX service company XXXX XXXX. Payments continued each month until XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX received a 6 month deferment due to her taking classes at XXXX XXXX U in Virginia. Payments were then renewed in XX/XX/XXXX for 8 months when another approved deferment occurred while she attended XXXX XXXX U full time as a XXXX XXXX. Monthly payments restarted in XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ( Records have been requested from firstmark ). Payments continued from the Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. As Administrator for the Estate I had repeatedly sent letters requesting Cosigner release and notifying Key Bank and XXXX XXXX that XXXX had died These letters were accompanied by the payment from the Estate and most via registered mailed. As the court appointed Voluntary Administrator we submitted the Death Certificate as required and requested cosigner release as well as loan discharge. All my letters were ignored and I am currently facing default if I dont pay. I have never received acknowledgement from Key Bank or XXXX of my requests for information, only form letters noting amounts due. Conversations with Key Bank Officials and XXXX XXXX were not productive either. The most recent contact with XXXX representatives was on XX/XX/XXXX, when I called to request why I had not received a cosigner release denial promised to be sent to me by a manager at XXXX in conversation ( with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ) and a representative from Key Bank. I requested a denial so I could confer with others as to my legal options. The rational e from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for not sending the letter I requested was that They dont send correspondence from their division. Bu I could be put in touch with another section of the company that did email communications. In addition, XXXX noted I had three choices : 1 ) I could refinance and pay off the debt, 2 ) I could start making payments including the amount in arrears or 3 ) I could stop payments and be in default and have legal action commenced against me. With respect to the cosigner release she informed me that I could not obtain aa release because at the time XXXX died and they got the Death Certificate I became the borrower and there was no longer a cosigner. Furthermore, I could not have requested a cosigner release because only the borrower could do that and one can not obtain a cosigner release retroactively. And that the rules had changed requiring that a borrower had to make 48 on time payments to be eligible for release of the cosigner in addition to having a satisfactory credit history as determined by the lender. 
It should also be worth noting that following the XXXX of XXXX in the spring of XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX to inquire about the cosigner release for the XXXXs. It was an extremely emotional discussion with the XXXX XXXX assistant and believes she cried as much as I did. I admit that I did not follow up with that discussion because having to tell XXXX she would not survive her ordeal was acknowledging defeat. She had not been given the XXXX XXXX at that time and there was so much hope and yearning for a positive outcome especially with the advances in XXXX treatment. Of course XXXX XXXX never sent me any information with which to follow up either and Im sure those recorded conversations are still available to Key Bank.",,KEYCORP,NY,12996.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3237430

( 18 ) Policy and procedures on how your customer serve reps are trained to read and evaluate information on your information systems and when the training took place. 
**All of the above listed information should cover the entire life of the loan. 
We hereby dispute all late fees, charges, inspection fees, property appraisal fees, compulsory insurance charges, legal fees, and corporate advances charged to this account. 
We have reason to believe that our payments made to the servicer on this note were inaccurately charged, and/or posted, causing unnecessary financial and emotional stress to us. The need for Taxes and insurance payments that were paid on this account were misapplied as of XX/XX/XXXX going forward to present. XXXX and XXXX Remitted payments of all of our escrow shortage in 2 payments from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I had to contact a corporate rep to help resolve the issue and I was assured the correction to the escrows were fixed. Still making weekly payments of XXXX weekly payment of XXXX was our monthly payments thus making EXCESS payments monthly. 
If the servicer did charge and apply payments properly there would be no escrow issues or misapplications of funds or needed reversals of some of our payments. The reversals of funds and applying them to our escrow now makes us have payment shortages as we pay towards the next month. On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed I was due for XX/XX/XXXX payment  even thought we had submitted XXXX in payments for the month. The chosen reversals put us in a potential breach situation due to SPS misapplication of funds. 
Since discovering this issue, we have stayed in contact with numerous people within your customer service departments, loss mitigation departments, and repeated requests for this loan to be reviewed and corrected by the executive office. I have spoken to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Who all assured me they would resolve it. I was advised that someone would contact me and there would be no problem getting assistance to bring the account current with reversals that were appropriate. 
A complaint with the CFPB complaint # XXXX was filed XX/XX/XXXX. I was told per SPS that the way I paid caused the misapplication. I was never informed that I couldnt pay that way and Told the associate why I paid it that way. NO ONE before the response to the CFPB EVER told me I couldnt pay that way. I was then that I was told I would have to have an increase in payment to cover the increase in escrow advances and now I have a shortage of suspense payments to cover this month. I have paid {$470.00} 3 times this month So that some of the payments were applied to last month after your company reversed only 2 months payments VS what they should have. Your misapplied practice of funds now has caused a possible impending default on the loan. Is this part of your business strategy? 
We both feel that we have been very proactive in keeping our family home. We do not want to lose our family home, and an application for a hardship withdrawal is in hand, to bring the loan due for XX/XX/XXXX. We must have a letter with the correct amounts since I have received 3 different new payments amounts. 
We have been given the runaround by your voice recognition call routing system on numerous occasions. I have talked to various agents with different versions of what the issues and how to solve it would take place. I have been re-routed to the wrong department or individual, dozens of times. This letter should serve, once and for all, to get the proper answers from your company. 
I understand that under RESPA you are required to acknowledge my request within 5 business days and must respond or try to resolve the issue within 30 business days, unless you notify me of the reasons for the delay before the expiration of the 30 business days, in that case you are allowed an additional 15 business days. 
In closing we are not trying to get out of paying the loan, we are only interested in getting the loan current and making timely payments for the remaining duration of the loan. IF this request is not responded to in a regulated time set for the by the government statutes, you are in violation I have the option to seek a legal remedy. My attorney may seek damages and settlement funds with a jury trial after a deposition of your managers I referenced above as well as your customer service representatives I spoke to. Possible violations include Unclean hands, breach of contract, estopple issues, res judicata, failure to mitigate, RESPA, FDCPA, TSPA, issues. My Attorney is awaiting your response to file and may file an action.

Rushmore told me today XX/XX/XXXX that they can not get the terms of the loan to match the terms that XXXX sent. Rushmore says XXXX is not responding, XXXX says Rushmore has everything they need. 

Originally, I was told that in order to start the trial modification I would need to pay {$10000.00} prior to the first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I expressed my concern about paying {$10000.00} essentially a down payment that was not noted in the agreement. There was no mention of the {$10000.00} anywhere, I went out of my way to continue to tell XXXX that this didn't seem right. Well my fears are now validated because Rushmore indicates the {$10000.00} is the very reason, they can not process my loan - because the {$10000.00} was not spelled out in the modification paperwork as a down payment - it is essentially showing that I made all the trial payments as a lump sum. 

As of XXXX nothing is resolved and I am still limbo with this loan. It is extremely hard to get anyone on the phone at either company.

1238,2018-11-23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Incorrect information on your report,,"BBVA - XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Score Ruined XX/XX/XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX, we ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) applied for a Construction XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX but were denied because of bad credit, low XXXX credit score. We were shocked, thought we had perfect credit. We are responsible business owners in our XXXX, pay all of our bills on-time, do not have any credit card debt and make a good living. Never saw this coming and we are devastated. Not only can we not obtain a mortgage for homeownership but we can not get loans to build XXXX XXXX XXXX is  our livelihood for the past 30 years. We are in trouble. 
Apparently BBVA had been sending our Visa credit card statement to an erroneous address and a {$40.00} charge did not get paid for months. BBVA made no attempt to notify us of this issue which ultimately ruined our credit and now we are unable to get a mortgage or spec house loans. As a matter of fact the Teller at BBVA researched our account and it showed that our Visa paper statements had all been sent back ( returned to sender ) to BBVA, so they were aware that we were not receiving these statements. 
Our BBVA Visa credit card was opened at the same time we got a {$120000.00} BBVA equity loan on our previous home, used loan to do some major remodeling. Loan was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We did not ask for, nor did we knowingly apply for the Visa card but BBVA offered the Visa card along with the Equity loan. They also offered us a discount on our loan payment if we opened a checking account and gave us a {$1000.00} overdraft protection account. Again all we applied for and intended to get was an Equity loan we never asked for the Visa, checking, or over-draft protection account.

At some point after opening equity loan, along with the other accounts BBVA threw in, we realized BBVA had an erroneous address for us so I ( K ) physically went into the local bank branch to have the teller go into our accounts and change our mailing address to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Note that our XXXX XXXX mailing address has been the same for over 20 years and is the only address that we have ever used. 
Currently our statements for the Equity line of credit, Checking and Overdraft Protection all show the corrected address. But not the BBVA Visa, it still shows a bad address that BBVA imposed on us when our accounts were established, which is 50 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --. Obviously the Teller did not change the address for the Visa at the same time she changed address on other accounts. Much to our ignorance we believed that when I physically went into the BBVA bank branch and changed our address to XXXX. XXXX that it changed our address for ALL of our BBVA accounts. This is how it works at XXXX XXXX where we have banked for over 30 years. But the Teller at BBVA did not notify me that the address change was not for all accounts so we had no way of knowing. 

Also, unbeknownst to us, the BBVA Visa credit card was never linked to our online account for us to see any activity and we had never received a paper statement to make us aware that the Visa card was not linked to our online account. Since never ever receiving a separate statement for the BBVA statement, had no idea there was a separate statement, we believed the blue Visa credit cards were linked to our BBVA checking and overdraft account. We never even used the BBVA Visa until 8 months after receiving card when we used it once for a {$40.00} computer security program again fully believing it was linked to our checking or overdraft account, which had and still has more than enough money to cover {$40.00}, so we certainly never thought about it not getting paid. 
The address shown on our BBVA Visa credit card statement is XXXX  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - which was an old address where we rented temporarily before we bought XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- house in XXXX of XXXX, financed by XXXX and got equity loan by BBVA. 
Note that we had lived at XXXX for a year before we obtained the Equity loan from BBVA so we would not have ever given the old temporary rental house address of XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - as our mailing or physical address. Our guess is the BBVA Mortgage Officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX-, or someone else at BBVA who inputted our information into the system, saw this address on our credit report ( I guess ) and inputted this bad address? Again our correct mailing address for over 20 years is XXXX. XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --. 
Also, I am not sure how we received the physical BBVA Visa credit card being that BBVA had wrong address on our Visa account. But when we moved out of rental house the summer of XXXX we did submit a change of address with the XXXX  Florida Post Office ( from XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and forwarded to XXXX. XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ), just to make sure if anything unknowingly sent here, any packages etc, they would eventually find us. So possibly the credit card was forwarded to us and is how we received. 
The change of address forwarding of mail through the postal service is only good for a certain amount of time possibly was in effect just long enough to get the physical card forwarded to us but shortly after expired before we could start receiving the statements. PERFECT STORM! 
So not only were we unknowingly not able to view our Visa statement on our online banking we were also unknowingly not receiving the paper statement by mail because BBVA did not change our mailing address as I requested, resulting in ultimately ruining our credit. 
Once we were made aware of the unpaid charges we immediately paid cash in person {$40.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at the local XXXX BBVA bank branch. Although the account is paid in full BBVA is still reporting the status of our account to the Credit Bureau as a Charge Off   which has ruined our credit score. We are not experts at credit reporting language but seems like if an account is paid in full by the consumer, it could not also be Charged Off, either is was paid in full OR it was charged off as bad debt. Which Charge Off seems to be the worst status to have, ruined our credit like its close to foreclosure or bankruptcy. In addition our BBVA Visa account currently shows that it is open and has a {$200.00} credit limit. Everything is conflicting as to the status of this account. 
Anyway we understand our part, our responsibility part, we made the {$40.00} charge and missed following up on it to make sure it was paid. Trusting our bank had our back, online banking linked, changed our address to correct and receiving our statements for all accounts. Although we are not 100 % to blame, BBVA holds some responsibility here too. Yet we are ruined, our bread & butter business ruined, no spec loans and possibly we cant qualify as a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX   for our customers. Plus the loss of obtaining home ownership - but BBVA remains unscathed and unwilling to help us out of this mess. This is not right! Is there anyone human at BBVA? If a human with common sense looked at the situation I dont think they would elect to ruin these people ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) over {$40.00}. Plus we are a BBVA customer, does this not mean anything? Why would BBVA want to ruin us? Does BBVA value their customers? 
We borrowed {$120000.00} from BBVA, made every payment timely and paid it off in full. Perfect customers. When the {$40.00} charge was made we had and still have the money in our BBVAs accounts to pay the {$40.00}. 
Bottom line - BBVA hooked us into this credit card offer with the equity loan mortgage. Then flubbed up by not having it logged in correctly so when we checked online it did not show up - and they used a bogus address to send the bill - when the bill was returned they made no good faith effort to correct their billing and notify the customer. Now no good faith in trying to correct the damage. As a matter of fact once we paid the {$40.00} balance on the Visa, BBVA changed the credit rating status from bad Delinquent Closed Account to an even worse status Charge Off!!! WHY????????????????????

BBVA hands are definitely not clean. They bear some weight of the burden here. It does not make common sense for a customer to pay off {$120000.00} and be a charge off for {$40.00}. What is wrong with this picture? Does anyone care enough at BBVA to get to the bottom of this fiasco and try to figure out a solution? 

TO RECAP : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX received {$120000.00} 2nd mortgage equity loan from BBVA 2. BBVA hooked on a credit card with the mortgage 3. BBVA hooked on a bogus address to the credit card 4. XXXX physically went to the BBVA branch to correct address 5. XXXX XXXX XXXX sold home, paid off BBVA {$120000.00} 2nd mortgage equity loan, perfect payment history, perfect customer 6. XXXX XXXX XXXX applied for mortgage to buy new house - found out CREDIT RUINED by BBVA - emotionally went to pieces and got sick-we are a small business, our credit rating is our life 's blood, we will be ruined 7. BBVA had not corrected our address on the credit card, therefore there was a mere {$40.00} balance that had not been paid by us because BBVA had flubbed up on changing our address. In fact they had  used such an old address where we didn't even live when they first issued the credit card. We have no idea where they dug up that old address. THIS WAS THE MAJOR FAULT THAT HAS CAUSED OUR DEVASTATING PROBLEM. 
8. We do not know why BBVA did not change address when we went to the branch to have this done, we do not know why they did not catch their mistake when the credit card statements were returned to them, we do not know why they did not note we had an overdraft protection on our account and had paid off {$120000.00} so we obviously would not try to dodge paying {$40.00}. Does this sound like clean hands by BBVA? Why can't they just realize there were many mistakes made by all the parties and take the "" charge off '' our credit report, and save our lives, STOP THE BLEEDING.",,BBVA FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,32540.0,,Consent provided,Web,2018-11-23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3081683

In my letter I detailed the issue and provided proof of my credit report showing their mistake. 

My dispute with Capital One is as follows : I had an old credit card that was closed due to non-payment back in XX/XX/XXXX. This card shows on my credit report as a negative against my score. ( This is accurate ) I made an agreement with a Capital One rep to open a new card and allow me to pay off the balance of the closed account. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was given a new card and the balance of my old card had been transferred over. My new card has been paid on time ever since, no issues there. 

The problem exists in the reporting. My old card shows as a negative closed account with the months for nonpayment. ( Accurate ) My new card shows as if it was open since XXXX, when it was open in XX/XX/XXXX. ( They are reusing the date of the old card ) My new card also shows the old nonpayments on it. ( Has never been late or missed ) Capital One is reporting one negative account twice. They are double reporting the same months of one account in both the old card and the new card.

1322,2019-03-07,Debt collection,Medical debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I received a medical bill from XXXX XXXX in XXXX that I believed to be in error. I have a medical history of hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroid. These medical conditions require me to get blood work done yearly. I have never paid anything more than {$20.00} for the bloodwork. 

When I received the bill I called my medical provider and explained the situation. She stated, it must have been coded incorrectly, Ill take care of it. I received 2 more bills in XXXX and called the medical office both times. Each time they said they would call and take care of it. The last communication about this issue was in XXXX, XXXX. I never heard anything more about it. I assumed it was resolved. 

As of the end of XX/XX/XXXX, the medical provider closed their office and moved to another office, not affiliated with the same hospital. My medical records did not move with her and I had to find another doctor. 

Fast forward to XXXX, XXXX. I started receiving a bill for {$190.00} from a company called XXXX. I admit I did not call this company as I thought it was odd I was receiving a bill for something that was supposed to be taken care of in XXXX. As I started repeatedly getting bills, I called the company in XXXX of XXXX. They would not do anything and demanded that I pay the bill. 

I then called the insurance company and talked with them. They looked into it and admitted it looked like a coding error. They tried to contact XXXX XXXX, and got nowhere with them. The hospital billing department refused to look into the situation. The rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX suggested I enlist the help of a 3rd party company that my company uses for these situation, XXXX XXXX. 

I started communication with them in XX/XX/XXXX. There communication with me was sporadic and I never really got any resolution. See below. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was drafted by a law from by the name of Overton , Russell , Doerr and Donovan , LLP. I sent a letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX stating that I was not admitting to this debt and I was working with the 3rd party XXXX XXXX. I asked them to take no further action. I also followed up with a phone call. The woman on the phone stated they were not acting as a debt collector ; they were actually acting as the lawyers for XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter written by the law firm was sent to me stating the debt was due. I gave this information to XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told me they were in the process of contacting the law firm. 

I heard nothing more from anyone. I happened to check my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. It was on this date that I noticed they put this as a negative remark on my credit report. 

I contacted the law from the next day and inquired why this was done. They told me they heard nothing from XXXX XXXX. I paid the bill in full at this time as I did not want this derogatory remark on my records. Lastly, they told me it is not in their policy to reverse this on a credit report. 

I immediately emailed XXXX XXXX and updated them on what was going on. They are unable to speak with anyone at the law firm and they are refusing to do anything about it. 

In conclusion, I still believe this bill was in error and was due to incorrect coding. I believe it is an act of fraud, as the hospital refused to look into the situation. I received bills in XXXX and then nothing again until XXXX, XXXX?! I tried to resolve the issue and gave all the paperwork all the companies requested, yet I got nowhere. I was forced to pay a bill I still believe to be in error, and more importantly I was sent into collections over this and it negatively affected my credit. I take my credit very seriously and if you were to review my credit, you will notice I have paid every bill on time. I am in the process of purchasing a house and I dont need this screwing up my credit.

1331,2019-03-04,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,,"I opened a personal loan with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) (XX/XX/XXXX ), who then sold the account to Tower loan ( unsure when they received the loan ). The loan was not in default with XXXX XXXX. I always paid the full amount due even if it were a few days behind. I never had an issue with debt with XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, me and my husband, became behind on the loan payment because both my husband and I became ill ( he having XXXX XXXX   and me having a XXXX XXXX ). Unfortunately, we were unable to make a timely payment due to medial conditions. This is when I learned of Tower Loan.

I received no notification that Tower loan had taken over the account until I became behind when sick. So, when I did get a few dollars to pay on my account this is when calls began because to tower loan the payments made were not a sufficient amount and on top of this they increased my interest and payments. Something I had no knowledge of. I explained to Tower loan my economic hardship, by letting them know this new amount was not agreed on and that I could not afford, but they didn't care. They wanted money. I remembered I had a loan insurance, so I asked about the insurance I had on the loan and if I could use it to catch up on payments. I was told yes and was given forms by the customer service rep who remains unknown. She is no longer working there. 

I was told the forms had to be filled out by a physician. I gave the forms to the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who worked with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( PCP ), but at the time he was convicted of medicaid fraud and could no longer practice medicine, which is why I think the first set of forms were misplaced. I went back to tower loans and received a 2nd set of blank insurance claim forms, but still have yet to get them from XXXX XXXX. He is no longer in an office. I now see XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who worked with XXXX XXXX. I gave the forms to her, and at this moment I am still trying to get her to fill out the insurance claim forms. I don't think she want to fill them out because I was a patient of XXXX XXXX. She is also requesting {$25.00} to fill out the forms. But, while in this process dealing with getting forms filled out and approved, I have been 200 % harassed by tower loan. Here are incidents as follows ; 1. Frequently visited my home asking for payments 2. Visited the hospital while I was an inpatient to seek a {$6.00} payment 3. Left a voicemail stating he was my mother ( who is deceased which is my grandmother ) stating they are seeking payment.

4. I have filed a restraining order on XXXX @ Tower Loan. He is not longer able to visit my house. 
5. Branch Manager of tower loan is now visiting the house.

6. Threatened of Wage Garnishment Due to all that happened, I filed a restraining order, and I was served a civil law suit by Tower loan 's lawyer. In court ( which was ruled in a hallway and papers were signed ) we ( me and my husband ) received a payment extension and agreed to pay {$260.00} ( my husbands loan ) and {$160.00} ( my loan ). Since court all payments have not been missed and paid on time. I was not given a set date to make a payment as long as the payment is made by the end of the month. The original payment date with XXXX XXXX was due on 1 loan which was XXXX of the month. The 2nd loan was due the XXXX of the month. 

Now I am being told that I need to make another extension by tower loan prior to the arrangement made in court and once again. The 1st arrangement they said has expired. 

Today, Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went in to Tower loan to make a payment. I gave them {$400.00} for my husbands loan ( {$250.00} loan mentioned above ) and {$200.00} for my loan ( {$160.00} loan mentioned above. I gave a cash payment to the cashier totaling {$600.00}, ( they only take cash, check, or money order ) to pay on the accounts respectively of what I mentioned above, and she felt the need to take out of the {$200.00} payment, {$50.00} and apply it to the {$400.00} cash payment for my husbands loan. When I said that this is not how I wanted the account to be paid, I was told that "" Louisiana is a community property state and that she has the right to take money from one account and apply it toward another account '' "" Then she proceeded to confirm that we were married, by asking, but the payment was already made. So, what if we were not married I asked? With no answer relative to us being married, she told me that the money could not be reversed. And I quote. This is what she told me. I am very upset with Tower Loan. I have been experiencing XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX behind this matter. And I have now have to have another XXXX related XXXX XXXX. I can't bleeding for worrying.

1342,2019-02-12,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a rate lock with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) for a cash-out loan in the amount of {$190000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.375 %. My total closing costs were estimated at {$4700.00} on line D of my Loan Estimate. I locked this rate. 

Shortly after, I was contacted by XXXX with a refinance offer where I would get an initial cash-out refinance, promising a secondary refinance at a sub 4 % rate with a long-term rate lock, and with the secondary loan being of no-cost to me. After some skepticism, I was re-assured that rates were priced through the end of the year since Global is a direct lender who can set their own rates. The no-cost refinance is also advertised on Globals website. I was assured that I would be able to get a 180-day rate locklikely at 3.8 % in XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as I had paid down some of my higher interest student loans ( which was the intention of the refinance ). I cancelled the XXXX loan on XX/XX/XXXX, and have emails and credit card statements supporting both the rate lock and the refund. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Closing Disclosure with a loan amount of {$190000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.99 % with the Total Loan Costs on line D coming to {$5000.00}. This is the loan that had a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. It should be clear that I accepted the terms of the XX/XX/XXXX loan because of the promises made for a long term rate lock at a considerably lower rate. 

XXXX did not lock the rate in XX/XX/XXXX, and between XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX I tried to push forward with the secondary loan, during which time lots of back and forth conversation happened. I have texts of correspondence during this time. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX claimed to have locked 4.25 % for 180 days the week prior to our messages, indicating that it should be able to go lower. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reiterated that, worse case scenario we have the XXXX and hoping that we can go lower, specifying that it should be able to get to XXXX. XXXX gave several excuses as to why the loan could not be closed until earliest XX/XX/XXXX, which was news to me but which he should have known the entire time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX informed me via phone call that the 4.25 % rate lock in XX/XX/XXXX had only been a 30-day lock, and that rates had since gone up and I could no longer get the 4.25 % rate. He said that he would lock a 4.5 % float-down rate at no cost to me, and would get me the paperwork by the end of the week. I had not received any correspondence or paperwork by XX/XX/XXXX, so I called Global and requested to speak to XXXX supervisor, with the intention of requesting a different loan officer. I was transferred to XXXX and left a message, which was never returned. I had requested to switch officers previously when XXXX mentioned that he had personal issues causing delays in correspondence, but he assured me that he could handle it and refused to transfer my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the loan was again delayed, which I found out was because XXXX was using my income from XX/XX/XXXX. This income pre-dated our business together, and there is no reason that XXXX should have been using that income. He pulled my credit without getting my permission, without notifying me, and without locking a rate. I was notified of an inquiry by a credit monitoring agency, and called the requester to learn that XXXX had been the one to make the inquiry. He apologized, but could not provide an instance when I gave him permission for the inquiry. I was unpreparednor did I believe it necessary considering his numerous promisesto contact other lenders during the mortgage window. XXXX is now demanding that I produce proof of a lower rate lock in order to honor his original promises. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX claimed to lock at 4.5 %, which I confirmed via text, but which also seemed to be untrue since he is now claiming that 4.625 % is the lowest rate that I can get without additional costs to me Throughout this process XXXX has repeatedly claimed that I would be able to get a sub 4 % rate and also to have locked at 4.25 %, but those claims were untrue. XXXX had also indicated that I could get a float down loan, but that was determined to be untrue without financial costs to me ultimately negating the benefit of a secondary refinance. Now XXXX claims that he is unable to offer the free refinance without a higher interest rate, which has none of the benefit that he reiterated again and again as his selling point in XX/XX/XXXX, and which is not as advertised on Globals website. This situation negates the cost benefit of the refinance and forces me to stay in a loan with a much higher rate that I would have had with my original AIM loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed indicating that a 30-year loan wasnt possibly and that we had discussed that before. I did not recall having discussed that at all, and when questioned about the occasion on which we spoke about it XXXX was suddenly able to get a 30 year loan. He also indicated at that time that a 3.875 % loan was possible with 2 points. This is the loan that I expected, with no points, as per his promise. Such a loan was clearly still possible in XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a Closing Disclosure with a loan amount of {$200000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.375 %. This comes with an additional Loan Cost of {$4400.00}. This represents a total Loan Cost of {$4700.00} + 6-mo in differential interest ( ~ {$600.00} ) more than if I had simply kept the original cash-out loan offer through AIM, which I had cancelled due to Dustins promises. 

In an attempt to remedy the situation, I informed XXXX that I had suffered some fairly straight forward financial losses due to his misunderstanding of rate lock policies and/or inability to lock as promised. I outlined my losses and presented options for correcting the loan, which were in keeping with his many promises, but which he indicated numerous times via email that he has no intentions of doing. XXXX insists on only looking at current market rates, and neglects his original promises that 1 ) I would be able to get a 180 day rate lock in XX/XX/XXXX when rates were considerably lower than they are now, and 2 ) that he has repeatedly assured me that worse case scenario I had a rate of 4.25 % locked.",,"Global Equity Finance, Inc.",CO,80918.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-12,Closed with explanation,No,,3148463

1372,2019-02-14,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was a victim of fraud and forgery while using my American Express Credit Card. I am writing to plead for assistance from The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ask for a thorough investigation with American Express, as they are condoning, disregarding and quite frankly encouraging fraudulent behaviors from their vendors/merchants. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my American Express credit card was charges 11 times for a total amount of {$8800.00} from a merchant named XXXX XXXX. I only authorized/signed for 2 charges - {$190.00} and {$1000.00}. I contacted American Express immediately once I noticed the pending charges. In speaking to the agent/representative, we were convinced the charges were an error as there were numerous and duplicate charges minutes apart from each other. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, all the charges posted and I immediately contacted American Express. The agent explained to me that they will open a billing dispute/inquiry with the merchant and made me feel comfortable that the charges are inaccurate and AMEX will get to the bottom of it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with an AMEX Message. The message was a note from the merchant stating that I am a regular customer and a copy of 5 out of 11 receipts. I have never been to this establishment prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the receipts and noticed my signature was forged on 4 of the 5 receipts ( the {$190.00} receipt being the only one I signed/authorized ). I did not authorized nor was I aware of the 4 other receipts. None of the descriptions on the receipts decipherable. Once again I immediately contacted AMEX, and explained them the charges were fraudulent and my signature was forged. They transferred me to the Fraud department and I was assured that AMEX is going to initiate a thorough investigation. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called AMEX looking for a status update and an update on the remaining receipts. The agent/representative explained to me the investigation is still pending and they have not received the additional receipts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a call to the Fraud department as they left me a voicemail. The agent/representative from the Fraud dept. explained to me that the fraud team will not investigate this case because I was present at the establishment with the card. The agent/representative requested I contact customer care to continue to investigate the case. I did not understand how this is not fraud as I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged. I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX that this was fraud and she transferred me to the fraud team. If this is not fraud I do not know what is Either way, I then contacted customer care again and the agent/representative explained to me that there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route. I was so devastated and disappointed with the agent/representative approach and response that I had to end the phone call. I took some time to compose myself from the disappointing way the previous agent/representative address the situation. I called back a few hours later and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor ( XXXX ) came on the line and immediately repeated the same message the previous agent/representative provide me ( there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route ) without listening to my concerns. I explained to her that I do not feel this was handled accordingly from AMEX from the very beginning. 
i.e. 
How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other There are 4 separate cases/inquires open and the agent/representative could not explain why 4 were open vs 1. They could also not explained why 1 was closed out the other 3 were still open nor can I decipher why The agent/representative agreed this was fraud and transferred me to the Fraud dept., the Fraud dept. did not even investigate the case even though I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged The agents/representatives and supervisor could not provide me any updates on the case or updates on the remaining receipts on every call I made to customer care.

There was a credit on my account for {$1100.00} ( {$390.00}, {$290.00}, {$290.00} and {$190.00} ). Two agent/representative could not explain the credit and the supervisor ( XXXX ) stated the credit was from the merchant b/c of the duplicated charges. Shortly after this was explained to me, I receive an email stating the credit is being reversed. 
Communication and updates have been poor and inadequate The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) At this point, I contacted and engaged the District Attorneys office to notify them of the fraud and unjust business practice from this merchant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I send an email to a member of the American Express Leadership team, to express my concerns on how American Express has managed and addressed the investigation/matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from an American Express Executive Assistant, stating they have received my email and are reviewing my inquires and concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the same American Express Executive Assistant, with an attached resolution letter stating We have extensively researched your concerns and determined all claims were investigated and correctly decisioned, because of the fact I was present at the establishment. Their outcome of all claims resulted in the following credits : {$1900.00} ( Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code ), {$500.00} ( tip amount from the {$1500.00} charge ), {$400.00} ( tip amount from the {$1100.00} charge ), and {$80.00} ( tip amount from the {$200.00} charge ).

I responded with my concern that this was not thoroughly and extensively reviewed as they stated. And requested a call to discuss the actions and steps that were taken to extensively research my concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the same American Express Executive Assistant, to review and address my concerns. I ask a number of questions and what steps/process were taken regarding how American Express came to their decision. She was very abrupt and refused to answer specific questions. Her common response was You were at the establishment. I explained to her that their vendor/merchant had possession of my American Express Credit Card for the duration of my stay at their business. During that time span, they processed 11 separate simultaneous charges without my authorization. They then provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. Because I was at the establishments does not mean I authorized the charges. Below are a few of the concern I attempted to discuss with the American Express Executive Assistant to no avail. 
Why was I, nor the vendor/merchant, not physically contacted ( Called ) during the investigation Did American Express review the Merchants history An explanation of the Charges ( I can not decipher the descriptions on the receipts And the merchant would not return my call ) Why certain tips were credited and not others. 
o Her explanation was, any receipt with an X marked on the line for a tip would be credited. 
o There were receipts with X marked on the tip line that were credited and not credited o She stated she will look into why there was inconsistency on American Express 's part with the credit issued for the tips Why was only one charge of {$1900.00} was credited.

o She states the Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code o I requested the purpose and meaning of entering the authorization and she refused to explain it to me.

Why did I not receive all of the requested receipts until weeks/months later from American Express ... I requested them numerous times and they finally provided 10 out of the 11 receipts to me in batches when they clearly had all of them from the beginning. ( I am still missing 1 receipt including the receipt I signed for {$1000.00} ) I received endless inconsistency with the credits provided. I was provided numerous credits on separate occasions and then the credits were removed on separate occasions. As a matter of fact, shortly after my call with the American Express Executive Assistant, where she went through and confirmed my credits, I received notice the same credit is being removed.

Inconsistent messaging form American Express employees o The numerous/separate cases caused inconsistent responses/messages from the customer care agents every time I called in. The Communication and updates were poor and inadequate. Each Customer Care Agents provided me a different and inaccurate update or were not able to provide me any updates at all.

The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other, while the vendor/merchant had possession of my Credit Card. They provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. 


I am pleading with The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter. The fact that American Express accepts/allows this vendor to provide dishonest business practice and fraud to any patron is unacceptable, disturbing and frightening. How can American Express support, allow and accept this merchant to continue to provide unfair, dishonest and fraudulent business practice in our community?

You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30004.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3408138

2. However, thereisasecondandthirdinstanceofnegligencenotedintheirfaxdated XX/XX/XXXX, and the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX : 2.1. As noted in the fax of XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX, the Collections Clerk for XXXX XXXX XXXX, they again neglected their proper duties and failed to report that the account was paid : ( Excerpt from letter ) "" However the notice of receiving the funds wasn't brought to the attention of the right person/department that handles the charge off report. This now has been taken care of, please report on XXXX XXXX that XXXX XXXX  XXXX charge off checking has been paid in full. '' 2.2. As noted in the letter of XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX, the Director of Compliance for XXXX XXXX XXXX, they neglected to refund one of the NSF fees as their entry of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX fell within the 60 day calendar window of my written claim dated XX/XX/XXXX. ( Which by that reasoning, all the entries from XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX would have fallen within that 60 day window. ) 3. The three aforementioned failures on XXXX XXXX XXXX   to follow proper protocols are pieces of evidence make it clear that XXXX XXXX XXXX failed me as a customer of their credit union when : 3.1. On XX/XX/XXXX when I first reported the unauthorized charge from XXXX, the representative did not complete the request properly, hence allowing future unauthorized charges from XXXX through.

3.2. Never sent any notices that the unauthorized charge needed further attention.

3.3. Never sent any notices that there were charges coming through over drafting the account.

3.4. In XX/XX/XXXX when I sent a written request to stop payment, they again failed to inform me that there was an outstanding balance that they were going to send me to XXXX  for ; the representative I spoke to again said theyd handle everything and let me know if anything else was needed, there was no further communications.

3.5. Finally, in XX/XX/XXXX, after being made aware of the balance owing per a XXXX report, I paid the NSF fees for the unauthorized charges that were supposed to have been returned.

3.6. In XX/XX/XXXX, they admitted that the balance paid was internally misfiled and never reported as paid to XXXX.

3.7. In XX/XX/XXXX, they admitted that after receiving my written request for stop payment, they should have refunded one of the NSF fees, but again, failed to report due to negligence on their part.

All this evidence clearly points to a failure in XXXX XXXX XXXX protocols that left me, as the customer : without the stop payment protection / unauthorized transactions protection I had submitted, with an unknown overdrawn balance on a rarely used account, that they reported to XXXX  ; in turn hurting my clean record which had NO reports.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

1635,2019-02-18,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,,"I have an unsecured consolidation loan w/ Citizens bank that was opened in the last 2 years for $ XXXX w/ $ XXXXpayment w/ my wife as a cosigner. This loan was initially and has always been serviced by XXXX XXXX. It was setup w/ a direct debit ( ACH ) from my savings account and for the first year or so was paid as agreed. In XX/XX/XXXX I sold a truck which had a $ XXXXpayment and in XX/XX/XXXX my wifes car w/ a $ XXXX/payment will be paid off. During XXXX we had some insufficient funds transactions that resulted in ACH missed payments. The relationship between Citizens and XXXX was always confused. There were times when I would return a call from Citizens & or XXXX to make a payment after a missed ACH and they would tell me the loan was current. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I called Citizens Bank/XXXX & spk w/ XXXX XXXX to make a payment and start the process of getting caught up. She advised me the account had charged off and I need to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX. I advised I was not comfortable dealing w/ a third-party debt collector and wish to pay Citizens bank directly she couldnt accept my payment. She stated the loan was charge off on XX/XX/XXXX by Citizens and that was early because the loan had not yet reach 120 days past due, and she suggested that we bring on XXXX. I agreed and she joined XXXX/XXXX ph # XXXX, who said the charge off was authorized by Citizens bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX officially sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that I needed to speak w/ them. I again expressed that I wasnt comfortable dealing w/ a third-party collection agency, but still XXXX couldnt help me. She did say another collections department at Citizens may be of assistance at XXXX. I then asked to speak w/ a manager at Citizens bank and XXXX brought on Manager XXXX , but he refused my payment, I asked for his supervisor and was told that person couldnt come to the phone, but they could have them call me w/ in 72 hours. I have received no return call as of XX/XX/XXXX. To all three individuals I expressed all of the above of about freeing up cash flow and I was prepared to bring this loan current in short order and honor the term of the original loan and that my loan be reinstated as only 7 days had passed since the charge, again XXXX refused my payment and told me I had to deal w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ph # XXXX and that Citizens nor XXXX could assist me further. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the representative stated I needed to settle the $ XXXX balance w/ them and suggested that I settle for an immediate {$12000.00} payment. I advised I couldnt pay that and wouldnt be doing so soon, the representative chuckled and said well that might be your opinion. I advised I wanted to deal directly w/ Citizens bank and the representative hung up on me. I called Back Citizens directly/XXXX spk w/ various managers advising I was not comfortable dealing w/ their 3rd party debt collector/suto law office and explained the immediate demand and the hang up. Citizen refused to help me and told me I need to deal w/ XXXX . I am ready to make payments to them immediately and bring my account current quickly ( I have advised them of this ). On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I called back Citizen bank again requesting to speak w/ a manager. I inquired about the 72-hour manager call back and they couldnt speak to that return call. I asked again for consideration on accepting my payments, but they again refused. I then requested a pay history since loan inception. They advised I needed to contact XXXX for the pay history online. I made the request with XXXX & have not received it. I am requesting Citizens bank reinstate my loan and I will catch up on pass due payments in the next 45days and ensure all future payments are made on time. I think Citizens being a very large institution can work w/ me here, especially since when I was advised of the action the XXXXhird party had only been engaged in the prior seven days and that over the course of the loan there were times I could have made payments after a missed ACH but was told by either Citizens or XXXX that I was not overdue and didnt need to make a payment.

Upon reading the notice, I saw that I had now been places in full repayment of my loan instead of paying the interest monthly. Prior to this notice, I paid $ XXXX monthly in interest. The new payment amounted to {$220.00}, which I was not comfortable with given my other monthly obligations. I called Navient and inquired about an the Extended Repayment option and their Rate Reduction +Extended Repayment option I saw on their website. I was told on the regular Navient call by the CSR that I would have to speak to their Credit Collections Department about these repayment options. I was somewhat confused by this information and asked the CSR if seeking either of these repayment options would impact my credit negatively. The CSR assured me that my credit would not be negatively impacted and that the Credit Collections Department just happens to be the department that handles those particular repayment options. I was forward over to the Credit Collections Department and a CSR began to assist. I explained my situation of being unable to pay the {$220.00} and she asked what payment I would be comfortable making. I told her {$100.00}. She asked me to hold and when she came back on the line she said {$120.00} was the best offer. I accepted this offer and she gave me information about the length of this reduced payment option as XXXX of XXXX. She also asked for my debit card info to have me signed up for automatic payments. I asked if I would have my information updated on Navients website and if I would receive any mailed information or documentation on the payment agreement that I had just arranged. She informed me that her department was different from Navient and that I can only call in to get information about my new arrangement. She also informed that something will me sent in the mail regarding my new payment. I was not told if my credit would be impacted and I was given no information about whether or not my previous regular payment arrangement would honor my new arrangement. I still had questions but I was at work and had to end the call. However, I decided to call after work because I still felt uneasy about my new arrangement. I also felt uneasy because upon checking my account during lunch break I didnt see any update on Navients website to my {$220.00} payment. I decided to call after work and around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I called and I asked the CSR if my credit would be impacted by me setting up this payment arrangement with Collections. The CSR explained to me that the payment arrangement set up with the Collections Department had nothing to do with the {$220.00} and that I would still be responsible for the {$100.00} balance outside of the new payment arrangement with them. She also informed that I would be late and delinquent if I did not pay the full amount. At this point I became upset and sarcastically retorted that if I had to still pay {$220.00}, I had no need to put myself through long holds and speaking with countless CSRs to have me at the same {$220.00}. The CSR sensed my frustration and placed me on a hold to find out more information. Upon returning to the call, she informed that the Collections Department had already closed for the day and I should call back tomorrow so the discrepancy could be resolved. I informed her that tomorrow I would have to restart the entire conversation with different individuals and probably have the same result. Although she attempted to be helpful, I got the impression that she wanted me off the phone so that I could be someone elses problem tomorrow.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,33647.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-31,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3325344

1721,2019-04-25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"On XXXX I get a bill saying I owe XXXX dollars for my Perkins loans. They are a new servicer for my university. I contacted them via phone and message asking for IDR plans. Here is what I wrote : Hello. I can not afford these payments now because I am unemployed. I live in XXXX XXXX Indiana where jobs are slim to none. Unless, I work at some fast food joint. I thought I applied for that income based repayment plan and it was explained to me that that was all I have to do and my federal loan payments will be reduced. However, I have this big bill from you. Can you please help me out? I broke my phone and don't have enough money to get a new one so can you please contact me via this portal or email? 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX There was no option for it and they told me it was only forbearance. All my other servicers gave me IDR plans and these are government loans so it should be available. 
on XXXX I received this message back : Dear XXXX, Thank you for contacting XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

As of today we are still finalizing with your lender what are the benefits avaible for this loan program, for the meantime may we advised you to download benefit form, in your portal, refer to benefit links< benefit forms. You may apply for Economic hardship, Unemployment deferment or General Forbearance, once complete you may send it to XXXX If we can be of further assistance, please call our office at XXXX. 

Sincerely, Borrower Relations XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I didn't want forbearance because I wanted to have payments count towards the number of years I was paying on time to have some of my student loans absolved after 10 years. I wrote them back : Wait. I'm confused, I don't want to be in forbearance. I thought income based repayment plans were like as if I was making payments but my payments are just low to XXXX dollars per month based on my income. I have XXXX income so I can not pay. Can you just enter in the IBR plan? I also just recertified it just in case that helps.I can send you my last tax documents. Can you tell me what I need to do to enter the income based repayment plan? NOT forbearance? 

I got the answer back : Hi XXXX XXXX, We apologize however XXXX doesn't offer income-based repayment. What we offer are Economic Hardship and Unemployment deferment which postpones payment on your loan or Forbearance which also postpones payment however interest will continue to accrue. 

If we can be of further assistance, please call our office at XXXX. 

Sincerely, Borrower Relations XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

So I called them at that number and they refused to understand and put me into an IDR. I don't need to have a doubled bill while I raise children just because interest accrues. This isn't right and no other loan servicer that I have forces these options on me. The agent spoke with a supervisor and then I was told to send the form from studentloans.gov to XXXX. 

All I got in return was this : Dear XXXX, Thank you for contacting XXXX   XXXX XXXX. 

We had informed you what are the options we had for deferment. If you want to apply for an IDR or IBR, you may apply for a consolidation. Most federal loans can be consolidated into the Federal Direct program that allows for IBR. You may visit the web site https : //studentaid.ed.govXXXX. There may be loan companies that provide consolidation of private loans and offer something similar to IBR. But please take note that consolidation is not for everyone, not everyone qualifies, and consolidation can mean the loss of some benefits from the original loan program. 

If we can be of further assistance, please call our office at XXXX. 

Sincerely, Borrower Relations XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

I have no clue why they are telling me about private loans consolidation, and why I have to consolidate to apply for IDR or IBR. No other loan servicer has this issue and this company is trying to get me to do something that will ruin me even further. I need them to do this correctly and understand what they are saying.

I asked about forbearance and was given The opportunity to spread the payments out between XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The gentleman was very nice and he mailed me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX so I mustve called in XXXX to say I was going to have problems not XXXX, and the letter reads that as of XX/XX/XXXX the total past due amount on your mortgage is {$2600.00} this amount includes all past due payment of interest and principal and escrow if applicable as well as late charges And amounts that we have paid on your behalf service or advances. Then it set up a three month payment schedule for me of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for paint {$2500.00}. When I attempt to make the arranged payment I am unable to make the payment as scheduled and I am told that as of XX/XX/XXXX I owe more than {$4500.00}? I make the XXXX mortgage payment anyway and then receive letters telling me last week I am now three months past due and owe over {$6600.00}? Then when I start making phone calls I start being passed from one person to the next to the next being told all kinds of lies and stories about money Stu and find to do and Im holding the ladder and asking questions and it was me that had called and asked for help and this is what happened. I need some help I dont wan na lose my home and all I did was miss onXXXX payment and I cant make any payments and they wont let me make any payments. Theyre making me pay more money than I owe and theyre asking for money that I never owed. Please help me. 

Then, in XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a payment into them and they applied it erroneously to someone elses account. When I asked where the payment was they finally looked for it and discovered that it was erroneously applied it to someone elses account almost a year later. This was not only not fixed they moved around monies and allotted all kinds of fees on my account and refuse to credit me appropriately the right principal and interest credits. In addition I made additional payments to my mortgage, instead of applying the payments to the principal as I applied them they didnt apply them at all. They didnt return the money to me they just wrote unapplied payments and kept the money and never applied them anywhere. If you look at the statements which I made screenshots of and I have attached here they just kept the money and didnt give me credit for it all nowhere. Then I called in to question the payment and I had mailed and payments that hadnt reached them yet, And the man on the phone told me that if I gave him the account number he would make sure that any of the paper checks that were mailed in were torn up. So I gave him my account number and the paper checks were not torn up and instead they charge me nonsufficient funds fee is and when I called up they apologize never remove them and theyre in my account anyway.

1813,2019-06-21,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,You never received your bill or did not know a payment was due,"In XXXX of XXXX I made a purchase at Home Depot with my Home Depot credit card in the amount of {$53.00}. Somehow I forgot about this, and never received any emails or letters about this unpaid bill, until XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Home Depot stating that I owed {$160.00} to be paid immediately or it would be sent to a collection agency. I quickly contacted Home Depot and they told me that I now owe over {$200.00}. I explained to them how I never received any emails and he looked up my account and told me that they had my wrong email address, he said it was my fault, he was very rude to me and told me that I could pay {$160.00} today, but if I do not pay right at that moment then the amount would go back up to over {$200.00}. I became upset due to being treated so rude by the employee that I ended the call with this employee. I called again the next day and spoke to someone else who told me they would take {$160.00} and we could be done with this. Again the employee saw that they had the wrong email address, she apologized, but stated she could not do anything about this. I paid the late fee with the understanding that this would help my credit, but then found out on my own research that Home Depot reported 3 late fees and a closed account on my credit report. I again called Home Depot and asked them to please take this off my credit report as I had not received any emails in regards to this bill and how I paid more than the amount I should have due to fees that were accrued. The person told me that she can not take anything off the credit report once it is reported, but that since I was such a good customer they would re-open an account for me. I declined this and contacted XXXX which made Home Depot tell me that they "" did an investigation and concluded that it was the fault of the consumer, not the banks '', because I am "" responsible for ensuring contact information is correct and updated ''. Due to a {$53.00} purchase, which I ended up paying {$160.00} due to a minor error and zero reminders from the bank, Home Depot has made my credit look, as if, I do not pay my bills. I wasn't even informed that they put anything negative on my credit. I discovered the negative information when a potential lender ran my credit for a potential loan purchase. I also discovered that my credit report didn't show the small amount of the purchase or that I paid the full amount including all the late fees. These actions by Home Depot and Citi Bank are not right and mischaracterize excellent citizens in order to relish the opportunity to damage an individual 's credit. 
I paid as soon as they sent me notification, this was the first time in 11 years as their customer to miss a payment, but they are treating me as if this was regular behavior and like I did not resolve the issue immediately. They do not care about their customers and they illegally do not inform their customers when they decide to report negative information on the customer 's credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,32962.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3283237

At the time that the fee was assessed, I had not made any new charges on the account since XX/XX/XXXX, so I considered whether I wanted to keep the card account and pay the annual fee or close the card for an annual fee refund. 

In my decision-making process, I relied on the following language in my cardholder agreement : You may close your Account by calling us or writing to us. 
If an Annual Membership fee applies, we will refund this fee if you notify us that you are voluntarily closing your Account within 30 days of the Closing Date of the billing statement on which that fee appears. For cancellations after this 30 day period, the Annual Membership fee is non-refundable. If an Annual Membership fee applies to your Account, it is shown on page 1 and page 2 of Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement. 

Ultimately, I decided to close my credit card account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service via the telephone number listed on the back of my Amex Blue Cash Preferred credit card with the intention of cancelling the account. This contact was within the 30-day period allowed in the cardmember agreement for closing the card for a full annual fee refund. 

When I reached a customer service representative and communicated my intention to close my account because I did not want to pay the annual fee, the representative offered to downgrade my Blue Cash Preferred account to the Blue Cash Everyday product. 

In my communications with the representative, I understood the offer to mean that upon the completion of the downgrade process, I would be able to keep the credit card account open and have my annual fee refunded. I had not made use of the card since XX/XX/XXXX and this appeared to be a logical and reasonable retention offer from Amex. 

I accepted the offer given by the representative. My online account reflected the change in card product, and I later received updated cards and documents reflecting the change. However, sometime later, I checked the card account activity online and noticed that the "" ADJUST MEMBERSHIP FEE '' transaction was a credit only in the amount of {$87.00}, rather than the full {$95.00} I was expecting. 

On the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service again via telephone to inquire about the discrepancy. The representative I spoke to mentioned something about the amount being a result of annual fee proration, but offered to submit a dispute inquiry for the discrepancy in what I was expecting. I was placed on a hold for several minutes, but the representative never returned back to the line and it appeared that the call was ultimately dropped. 

Later in the day, I contacted customer service again to inquire again about my issue, as I did not believe I had concluded my business in the previous call. This time, the representative I spoke to said something to the effect that my reduced refund was a result of my card having been open at the time the fee was assessed, and that my request to adjust the amount of the annual fee would not be considered. 

Assuming that what the representative stated was accurate, I am troubled for several reasons. The first is that, assuming that I have characterized the policy correctly, the proration of annual fees even for downgrade requests within 30 days after the assessment of the annual fee was not clearly communicated to me. I do not recall the representative with whom I requested account closure say that the annual fee assessed would not be refunded to me in full. If I had been aware of this fact, I would have chosen to close the card account instead. 

The second reason is that the annual fee refund posted past the 30-day period mentioned in the cardholder agreement in which I would be entitled to a full annual fee refund if I closed the account. If this had happened earlier within the cancellation window, I could have had the opportunity to change my mind and decide to close the account instead. At this point in time, I am outside the stated period, so a request to close the account now would not have any effect on the annual fee refund. 

In addition, this proration policy was unexpected to me, having dealt with annual fee refunds from account downgrades and closures with other issuers before ( e.g., XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). In those situations, I have received full annual fee refunds whenever they were requested within the stated annual fee refund period. Amex 's policy does not seem to be in line with the practices of other credit card issuers. 

I will also observe that, as I had not used my card for purchases since XX/XX/XXXX, I could hardly be claimed to be taking advantage of Amex 's annual fee refund policy by making use of card benefits just before requesting an annual fee refund by account closure. If I had requested full account closure in my original contact with customer service, I don't believe I would be in this situation now. 

To date, I have had mostly positive interactions with Amex, and I have other card accounts with Amex. I feel that on this issue, however, I have been misled by Amex customer service, preventing me from attaining the full annual fee refund by account closure that I originally intended. My customer service experience makes me reconsider whether I should continue to keep my card accounts open and use them for purchases in the future.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,TX,75094.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3245373

1929,2019-05-28,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Let 's start with just because this company responds to a complaint doesn't mean anything is resolved. I have tried for a modification because the one in XXXX which was supposed to be permanent is not. I get a letter every so often saying that my rates increased due to escrow shortage and my rate is well over {$800.00}. I asked for a modification and received no response. Even asked since they claim XXXX XXXX is the noteholder for their guidelines. I never received anything. I still have not received if my modification was denied or what my options were. I check my county 's records and see my house is set for a sheriff sale on XX/XX/XXXX. I know it's funny to you all because the HUD secretary even joked about it. This company is addicted to REOs and kicking people out of their homes. This single mother of XXXX  is not. I will no longer fight. I will however go for a deed in lieu or better yet, I'll file for bankruptcy the day of the sale. Since that seems to be what SPS wants. 
I had a company do a title search and I even paid a company to deal with SPS, and you can see attached. XXXX is still the bank of record on my title. I will fight this in court, and I will even show proof of forged documents by SPS and their attorneys. 

This settlement includes a statement of facts to which XXXX XXXX has agreed. That statement of facts describes how XXXX XXXX made false and misleading representations to prospective investors about the characteristics of the mortgage loans it securitized. ( The quotes in the following paragraphs are from that agreed-upon statement of facts, unless otherwise noted. ) : XXXX XXXX told investors in offering documents that the mortgage loans it securitized into RMBS were originated generally in accordance with applicable underwriting guidelines, except where sufficient compensating factors were demonstrated by a prospective borrower. It also told investors that the loans had been originated in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including all predatory and abusive lending laws. 
XXXX XXXX has now acknowledged that XXXX XXXX repeatedly received information indicating that many of the loans reviewed did not conform to the representations that would be made by XXXX XXXX to investors about the loans to be securitized. It has acknowledged that in many cases, it purchased and securitized loans into its RMBS  that did not comply with applicable underwriting guidelines and lacked sufficient factors and/or w [ ere ] not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. XXXX XXXX employees even referred to some loans they securitized as bad loans, complete XXXX and [ u ] tter complete garbage. 
XXXX XXXX acquired some of the mortgage loans it securitized by buying, from other loan originators, Bulk packages containing numerous loans. For example, in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX purchased a Bulk pool of approximately 10,000 loans originated by XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX selected fewer than 10 percent of these loans for due diligence review. Reports from XXXX XXXX due diligence vendors showed that approximately 85 percent of the loans in this sample violated XXXX underwriting guidelines and/or applicable law, but XXXX XXXX securitized over half of the loans into various RMBS  it then sold to investors. XXXX XXXX did not review the remaining unsampled 90 percent of the pool to determine whether those loans had similar problems. Instead, it securitized an additional {$1.00} XXXX worth of unsampledand therefore unreviewedloans from this pool into various RMBS it then sold to investors. A XXXX XXXX manager wrote to another manager who was reviewing these loans, Thanks for working thru this mess. If it helps, it looks like we will make a killing on this trade. 
XXXX XXXX acquired other mortgage loans for securitization through its XXXX   channel. Through this channel, XXXX XXXX bought loans from other lenders one-by-one or in small packages, and also itself extended loans to borrowers as Wholesale loans. Approximately 25-35 percent of the loans XXXX XXXX acquired from XXXX to XXXX were acquired through its mortgage XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX employees discussed in internal emails that for XXXX loans, the loan review and approval process was virtually unmonitored. For loans XXXX XXXX purchased through its XXXX, XXXX XXXX told investors, ratings agencies and others, XXXX XXXX senior underwriters make final loan decisions, not contracted due diligence firms. XXXX XXXX has now acknowledged, For XXXX loans, these representations were false. 
XXXX XXXX has acknowledged that [ a ] XX/XX/XXXX audit by XXXX XXXX audit department gave the XXXX a C rating on an A-D scale ( the second worst possible rating ) and a level 4 materiality score on a 1-4 scale ( the highest possible score ), and that a XX/XX/XXXX evaluation by XXXX XXXX of one of the third-party vendors it used to review XXXX loans similarly reported that There are serious concerns as to compliance [. ] Between XXXX and XXXX, XXXX XXXX managers made comments in emails about the quality of XXXX loans and its process for reviewing those loans. For example, a top XXXX XXXX manager wrote to senior traders, Of course we would like higher quality loans. Thats never been the identity of our [ mortgage ] XXXX, and were becoming less and less competitive in that space. A senior XXXX XXXX trader, discussing the fulfillment centers XXXX XXXX used to review XXXX loans, stated in an email : we make these underwriting exceptions and then we have liability down the road when the loans go bad and people point out that we violated our own guidelines.... The fulfillment process is a joke. 
For example, in one instance XXXX XXXX approved, through its XXXX, a purchase of over {$700.00} XXXX worth of loans originated by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX senior traders referr [ ed ] to XXXX XXXX  loans as complete XXXX and [ u ] tter complete garbage. Despite this, XXXX XXXX provided XXXX XXXX with financial incentives in exchange for loan volume [ and ] securitized XXXX XXXX loans into various RMBS it then sold to investors. 
XXXX XXXX has acknowledged that it also received reports from vendors that it might have been acquiring and securitizing loans with inflated appraisals and that its approach for reviewing the property values associated with the mortgage loans could lead to the acceptance of inflated appraisals. In XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX manager wrote to two senior traders, How would investors react if we say that 20 percent of the pool have values off by 15 percent? If we are comfortable buying these loans, we should be comfortable telling investors. 
XXXX XXXX used vendors to conduct quality control on a small subset of loans it acquired. XXXX XXXX has now acknowledged that its quality control review vendors reported that more than 25 percent of the loans that they reviewed for quality control were  designated ineligible because of credit, compliance, and/or property defects. 
XXXX XXXX has now acknowledged that its Co-Head of  Transaction Management expressed concern that the quality control results could serve as a written record of defects, and sought to avoid documented confirmation of these defects. In XX/XX/XXXX, a top XXXX XXXX manager met with others to discuss implementing this reduction of quality control review. XXXX XXXX Co-Head of Transaction Management wrote that this change was to avoid the previous approach by which a lot of loans were QCd... creating a record of possible rep/warrant breaches in deals.... 
In another example, in XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX employee identified two wholesale loans XXXX XXXX itself had originated and wrote, I would think that we would want to see loans like these that seem to represent confirmed problems, especially on our own originations. Why do we have an appraisal watch list and broker oversight group if we arent going to review the bad ones and take action appropriately?... I just see so many of these cross my desk, fraud, value, etc., its hard to just let them go by and not do something. XXXX XXXX  Co-Head of Transaction Management  responded, I think the idea is that we dont want to spend a lot of $ to generate a lot of QC results that give us no recourse anyway but generate a lot of negative data, so no need to order QC on each of these loans. The employee then stated, I think the lack of interest in bad loans is scary. 
As another example, in XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX employee identified 44 Wholesale loans XXXX XXXX had itself originated that had gone 60 days delinquent. XXXX XXXX Co-Head of Transaction Management wrote in response, if we already know : that the loans arent performing... the only thing QC will tell us is that there were compliance errors, occupancy misreps etc. I think we already know we have systemic problems in FC/UW [ fulfillment centers/underwriting ] re both compliance and credit. The downside of QCing these 44 loans is, after we get the QC results, we will be obligated to repurchase a fair chunk of the loans from deals, assuming the loans are securitized and the QC results look like the QC weve done in the past. So based on a wholesale QC historical fail rate of over 35 percent ( major rep defects ), the avg bal of wholesale loans and the loss severities, it is reasonable to expect this QC may cost us a few million dollars. XXXX XXXX has now acknowledged that it did not inform investors or ratings agencies that its Wholesale loan channel had a QC historical fail rate of over 35 percent ( major rep defects ). 
XXXX XXXX commented about the mortgage loans that accumulated in its inventory. For example, XXXX XXXX Co-Head of Transaction Management wrote to another XXXX XXXX manager that loans with potential defects pile up in inventory.... So my theory is : we own the risk 1 way or another.... I am inclined to securitize loans that are close calls or marginally non-compliant, and take the risk that well have to repurchase, if we cant put them back, rather than adding to sludge in inventory.... One of the senior traders responded, Agree.  In another instance, a XXXX XXXX senior trader commented in XXXX that we have almost $ XXXX of XXXX garbage to still distribute. In another instance, a XXXX XXXX trader wrote to a top manager,  discussing another bank to which XXXX XXXX was seeking to sell loans from its inventory, and stated, [ The other bank ] again came back with an embarrassing number of diligence kicks this month.... If their results are in any way representative of our compliance with our reps and warrants, we have major problems. But rather than holding these loans in its own inventory, XXXX XXXX securitized certain of these loans into its RMBS. 

Original review : XX/XX/XXXX We asked for help with our payments. They said, "" No problem. Send us paperwork to fill out. '' Sent in. Was told not filled out right. So went over all the paperwork with lady at the co. She said it was right and everything was there. That was in XXXX XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. Every time we called to check on the paperwork the lady was not there. Off that day. Always. Finally got hold of someone today and they said all of the paperwork was not there. They said they sent us info about it, never received. They told us they tried to call. Never did. Now they say we have to start all over again. They have our address and we never received anything from them. We have requested several times a history report of our mortgage because they say we took a XXXX loan against our mortgage years ago. We did not never. All we ask is a copy of the canceled check. They said they have sent all that. Never received it. They just say what they want you to hear. 

I am going to call around and see if it is possible to have them investigated. People please call around and have this happen. I pay enough. Sometimes I can't go to the store for food. I can't pay my medical and my health has suffered. No co. should have this power. I am sure no one will read this because they will take it down. 

Representatives ill-informed and don't really have any idea what they're talking about. Keep sending me unwanted and unsolicited info I have not requested. They do not send statements in a timely manner. Utterly clueless and out of touch with customers. Not helpful and at times can be very rude. Who told them they give excellent customer service as stated on their website? 

Original review : XX/XX/XXXX Like many other complaints, my mortgage was sold by XXXX XXXX to this company several months ago. It has been nothing but trouble since. They recalculated my escrow account and sent me a check for {$940.00}. I did my calculations and realized it would leave me short when it came time to pay my insurance and taxes. So I called, was instructed to send it back, and told they would recalculate. Here we are almost a month later, they have no record of receiving the check back, have not adjusted my account, have not recalculated. NOTHING. They tell me they will put it in for "" deep research ''. After reading these reviews, I am SO worried. 

Original review : XX/XX/XXXX This company is so behind in current mortgage practices. They are completely corrupt and incompetent. The excuses they make for their inaccurate account history is beyond belief. Turn and run from these numbnuts. You'll waste an incredible amount of time hand holding them through banking and mortgages 101. Just turn and run. 

Original review : XXXX XXXX, XXXX This company is notorious for losing paperwork, raising interest rates for no reason and ludicrous excuses to not work with you. Paperwork was faxed numerous times with return receipt, and still lost. Why are they still in business? SPS evades any complaints against them. Worse mortgage company in industry. 

Original review : XXXX XXXX, XXXX My loan was transferred from XXXX ... I had 3 payments total to paying off the loan. I tried to have them take the pay off balance via phone from a registered account. After being told online they would take it they didn't. Leaving me a late payment because they lied and didn't take the payment. 2nd call they proceeded to tell me A. They couldn't take the payment for pay off over the phone or online nor could they tell me what the pay off balance was. It's straight up fraud! In order to collect late fees and more interest. I never agreed to having my loan transferred to this company. They informed me the only way to send payoff is thru XXXX XXXX. Another large fee! 

Where in XXXX XXXX name did America allow such businesses to rake customers thru the coals like this? It seems to me it's outside of any laws I've ever dealt with. We customers should be compensated for the inconvenience of having to deal with such XXXX! I just want to pay the loan off. Not be tread all over and told, "" No you can't. '' I think they'd like to take my house for the {$160.00} I currently owe. Ridiculous and complete insanity! No customer service that helped. 

Just a few other consumer complaint and even the Justice Department 's statements, but yet, nothing is done w/ this corrupt company.

My husband & I purchased a vehicle, a XXXX XXXX XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX located at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, La XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The salesman that sold us the vehicle name is XXXX XXXX. I met XXXX at my job because he had recently sold my coworker her truck. He came to my job in the XXXX XXXX to check and see how my coworker liked her new truck. Of course with him being a salesman he asked if I was looking for a vehicle. I told him that my husband was trying to find him a work truck and Mr. XXXX suggested that I take a look at the XXXX XXXX he was in. I stepped outside to look at the truck and I contacted my husband to see what he thought about the truck. My husband said he was interested in it and Mr. XXXX then proceeded to get our information to start the process on purchasing the truck. Mr. XXXX called me while I was at work and told me we were approved and that we had to put {$500.00} down to get the vehicle. I informed him that I would have to make arrangements to get the vehicle due to me living in XXXX, La. He then agreed to drive the truck to my house in which someone was going to follow us in another vehicle to bring him back to XXXX. My husband and I signed the paperwork in our home. We never once stepped foot on the dealership not even to speak with a finance person. He told us that the truck was financed with the bank XXXX XXXX and we could call and pay over the phone. Were young, had just made a year of being married and were excited to be making our first purchase together. With us never purchasing a vehicle before Ill admit that there were a lot of mistakes we made. One mistake was us not even going to the car dealership. The other was NOT speaking to a finance person at all before making the purchase. Two weeks later my husband called the bank to pay the note being that it was due XX/XX/XXXX and he was informed that we didnt have anything with that company. We then found out that the vehicle was financed through Consumer Portfolio. Well also within those two weeks after getting the truck it stopped running. After getting multiple people to look at it we discovered that the fuel pump had went out in it. We made the decision to return the truck back to the dealership. My father and husband had to load the truck on a trailer due to the fact that it was not running so it could be returned back to the dealership. Once they got there they tried to refuse receiving the truck. My father and husband explained to them that we did not have the truck long enough to even make the first payment before it stopped running. My father also mentioned that he didnt think the proper procedure was taken in selling us the vehicle due to us never meeting with an actual finance person so that the financing on the truck could be explained to us. The vehicle was left at the dealership but Consumer Portfolio is  still trying to get us to pay for the vehicle. This has affected our credit tremendously and I would like for it to be removed. I have been told that the truck was sent to an auction and was sold. I do not feel we are responsible for paying the remaining balance on the vehicle due to the fact that it was returned before the first note was due, no payment was ever made and it has been sold to someone else.",,"Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.",LA,71019.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3198085

- I've fax and mailed CERTIFIED MAIL /AN AFFIDAVIT OF DENIAL OF DEBT which has not been answer yet which brings me to the conclusion of the impersonation of a government official, because only a government official can ignore my document requested to be answered in the fashion that CAPSTONE has. 

-CAPSTONE HAS INSULTED ME ... by saying ''It appears he is mistaking the amount of time an account may remain on a credit report with the statute of limitations for legal remedy. '' .... I know exactly what statue of limitations I'm talking about, it is very clear that CAPSTONE is trying to collect a debt without proof of ownership of the account to me, also past the statues of limitations - insults number two "" Furthermore, this account is a result of a broken rental contract with an apartment complex. It is not a credit card, promissory note, auto or installment loan. '' THIS IS WHAT CAPSTONE RESPONDED WITH TO MY COMPLAINT .... 
If there referring to a signed document containing a written promise to pay a stated sum to a specified person or the bearer ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ) at a specified date or on demand. 

-Translate promissory note that's the definition of a promissory note which no proof has been shown or provided to me CAPSTONE is saying i broke a rental agreement where is the agreement? who provided a THIRD party of this Alleged document or documents?, i need answers i need someone to swear that this debt is 100 % accurate and it belongs to me with proof!. 

-insult number three ''Mr. XXXX has disputed this account via the XXXX service, to which we responded their information matched ours on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX '' there saying that they matched records that they provided to public records, which is CLASSIFIED AS FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS at this point by verifying documents they submitted, which is illegal. how can they say that the account is my account basically just by saying it is? that's my question to CAPSTONE -insult number four ''On XX/XX/XXXX Mr. XXXX called our office and explained he wants to clean up his credit. He requested to settle the account for a lower amount than we are authorized to accept as well as to have the account deleted. We were not able to accept this offer. ( We counter offered a higher settlement ), but Mr. XXXX turned down the offer '' - Proof that CAPSTONE COLLECTIONS tried to collect this debt UNREASONABLY- I offer to settle a debt that's not clarified as my debt CAPSTONE clearly turned it down an told me that i should pay more to settle this alleged debt with no proof of this even being my debt. 

As i stated before : "" In North Carolina, Section 1-52.1 of North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure Explains the statue of limitations for debts is 3 years for auto and installment loans, ( PROMISSORY NOTES ) and credit cards '' Why are they reporting this to the credit bureau when its past the statute of limitations CAPSTONE is updating records as of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX '' reporting and collecting? as CAPSTONE CLEARLY STATED in the last complaint. verifying an alleged account with no proof of ownership.By reporting and validating this debt with the credit bureaus it is misrepresenting the debt and the legal status of it which is a violation of the FDCPA according to my attorney",,"Capstone Credit & Collection, LLC.",NC,28269.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358665

1995,2019-05-05,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s )  and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NY,11797.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-05,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3233029

2017,2019-06-02,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with additional products or services purchased with the loan,"/My husband and I went to the XXXX, AZ Nissan dealership because a close friend recommended the owner as an honest businessman. We spent 8hrs at the dealership on XX/XX/XXXX and were assured a loan with 8 % interest and a $ XXXX/mon payment with GAP insurance, a maintenance service contract and extended warranty. We were very upfront about my husband 's situation, including that he had no credit history and was a permanent resident. The owner assured us this was not a problem. We traded in my husband 's car for {$1000.00} reduction of the loan, and paid a {$500.00} cash deposit. We signed the paperwork and left with the new car. 

Three days later we were called back to the dealership by the finance person, XXXX XXXX, and told there was a problem with the paperwork and we had to come back in. We did go back to the dealership on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX told us that the 8 % deal did not go through and we had to sign a new deal. When I asked why the deal didn't go through he told me it was because my husband had no credit history and was only a resident. I let XXXX know that we had already discussed this a week ago and had been very upfront with them at the time of purchase when were were assured the original deal. XXXX said it didn't matter and this was the circumstance and we had to sign a new transaction. 

This was my husband 's first new car purchase and after driving the car for a week already he was in love with it and wanted to keep it. So my husband agreed and began signing paperwork again. 

As my husband was reviewing the final papers with XXXX, I noticed that the interest rate was now 17.55 %, the GA/P insurance was not listed, nor was the extended warranty, and the monthly payments were over $ 450/mon. At that point I was enraged, told my husband to stop signing, as I was not going to allow him to enter into a bad financial deal. I told XXXX we were NOT taking the car, to give us our trade in back and we would be going elsewhere to purchase a vehicle. 

Then XXXX told me to "" hold on '', he would get the owner. The owner came into the room and asked me what the problem was, and I told him that we were promised certain terms, which we signed for and drove away with the car understanding the deal was finalized. That we were NOT okay with the current situation and wanted our car back. The owner told us to leave with the car, he would personally guarantee that the original terms would be met and they would call us back. 

Another 10 days later, on XX/XX/XXXX we went back to the dealership and signed the "" final '' papers, that "" guaranteed '' our loan with Nissan Finance at 8 %, $ XXXX/mon, and was only supposed to have GAP insurance coverage, with no service contract or extended warranty. When my husband signed the "" final '' deal, there was a line listed as "" service contract, {$2100.00} '' and when I asked XXXX if that was the GAP insurance, he assured me it was. I asked for a copy of the "" final '' paperwork and XXXX told me not to worry about it, they would mail me a copy. 

We were never "" mailed a copy ''. 

We made all of our payments to Nissan, often times overpaying to pay down the principal faster. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my husband was hit by another car on his way to work. The accident was severe and I was fairly certain our auto insurance company was going to total the car out, due to the FMV of the vehicle at the time and what it would cost to fix the damages. It was also as I was starting a new job and training, and my husband and I were and are working opposite schedules. 

My husband needed to go to the emergency room as a result of the accident, and I began dealing with our insurance company and dealing with finding a rental vehicle so my husband could continue to work. As I tried to get ahold of Nissan Finance, they were not available after XXXX when I was off work or the weekends. The phone number I was given on my voicemail to call did not allow for a message to be left and just hung up on me. My car insurance claims agent also took a week off for vacation a week into the claim and was unable to be reached. When he returned from vacation and communicated that they were indeed totaling the vehicle, I was again go back in touch with the tow lot to give them an update ( it had been 2 weeks now from the time of the accident and tow ) around XXXX, upon which I was informed that Nissan Finance had just repossessed the vehicle that morning, Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I tried to online chat with a Nissan Finance agent that Friday, XX/XX/XXXX because their department was on CST and already closed, at which time the agent told me he was unable to help me but gave me a phone number that would have a person available to speak with on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX CST. I thanked him and ended the chat. Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX I called the phone number but was shocked to learn it was an 800 #  for XXXX. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I finally was able to get through on my 30min lunch break from work to reach a Nissan Finance person, but was told that my husband would have to call in and give permission for Nissan Finance to speak to me. I hung up, called my husband immediately and asked him to call and do so, which he did. By the time this all happened my lunch break was over. 

I called on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX to try and 1 ) find out where the car was physically located so I could relay that information to my car insurance claims adjuster so they could complete their final valuation of the vehicle, and 2 ) to get our personal items out of the vehicle, and 3 ) stop any auction of the car. The Nissan Finance company bounced me back and forth between their total loss department and collections department for 35mins. I had to hang up and go back to work. 

On Wednesday, XXXX, I called back again and had the first representative I spoke with make a note in my husband 's record about the circumstances and asked her to please not bounce me between departments. I was finally given the repo lot company 's name and phone number, but was told they were not able to give me the physical location, I would have to call the lot and get that information myself. I hung up, called the lot and obtained the information and scheduled an appointment for my husband to pick up our personal items from the vehicle. Then returned to work. 

On Thursday, XXXX, I called Nissan again on my lunch break and requested that a GAP claim be initiated because we owed more than what the car insurance company was going to pay for the total loss, and was told that we DID NOT HAVE GAP COVERAGE! The agent sent me an email with an attached file of what they had on record and told me my husband and I would have to go to the dealership and have them update the contract on file to reflect GAP coverage. That night when I got home from work I called the dealership and asked to speak with a person in the finance department. I was given to "" XXXX '' ( not sure how to spell his name ). XXXX told me that there was no GAP coverage on record. I told him what happened at the time of purchase and he told me that XXXX no longer worked with them and that the only thing they could do would be to refund the "" service contract '' of {$2100.00}, but that my husband had to be the one to do that. 

So Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I went to the XXXX Nissan dealership and asked to speak with the general manager, understanding that we would have to sign some paperwork after requesting the money refunded and be able to leave. We were shown to the GM 's office ( XXXX ). I told him the entire history of the situation, including that his finance person, XXXX, told us to come down to sign papers to request the service contract refund. XXXX told us that he was very sorry, but that XXXX did not work there anymore, he was sympathetic to our situation, but that our records were in physical storage and would have to be pulled for him to look at and verify to see what he could do. I showed him ALL of the original papers that I had kept together from the purchase, including ALL maintenance records on the vehicle since we had only serviced the vehicle at their dealer 's service department. He looked at the papers, but said he would have to look and see what they had in records, even though it was clearly evident that I had all of the carbon copies. He would call me back on Monday and let me know. I told him that my husband and I work opposite schedules and are only able to come together on Saturday mornings to sign papers. 

Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was left a voicemail while at work that we indeed did not have GAP insurance and there was nothing the dealer could do. My husband and I went back to the dealership on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX and again asked to speak with XXXX. I told him, that it was pretty XXXX that he would not stand up and do the right thing because the finance person was no longer an employee, that excuse was flimsy, and that the documents filed in storage were clearly misleading. He said he would have to speak with the owner and see what he could do because it "" was his money ''. We left again waiting for another phone call from XXXX. 

We did not receive a phone call, and were unable to go to the dealership on Satuday, XX/XX/XXXX due to a prior obligation, but DID return to the dealership on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX because I had the day off due to the XXXX XXXX holiday. XXXX had another finance person join us this time to explain to me that the GAP wasn't included because a document was in the file that showed it was removed. I had a copy of that document and pointed out to the GM, XXXX, that it was from the XX/XX/XXXX deal that we did NOT accept, which was indicated at the bottom of the record through XXXX 's personal handwriting that also stated "" finance rate increased '' as to the reason the GAP was removed. I told him that was not the final deal we signed, because IN FACT, the finance rate did NOT increase, but was at 8 %. I told him even if they were not going to honor the GAP coverage, they needed to refund the {$2100.00} service contract that was clearly outlined on the document. After not returning my GAP document, XXXX, the GM, told me he would have to contact our insurance agent to confirm that they had not cancelled the contract, because insurance agents "" do that to decrease the amount they have to pay out for the vehicle ''. When I told the GM that there was no way our insurance agent would have done that because they would have had to have had our permission AND that we had already been to the dealership THREE TIMES trying to cancel the contract ourselves to get the money refunded, the GM said that he wouldn't be able to do anything because it was XXXX XXXX, a holiday, and everything was closed. He promised they would call me back on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX with news. 

Tuesday came and went. I called the dealership yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, but was put through to the GM 's voicemail. I was around XXXX, and I left my phone number and a message asking him to please return my phone call as he promised by the end of the day. 

He did NOT return my call. 

Nissan Finance is now charging us {$1200.00} in fees for repossessing the vehicle and late fees for "" missing monthly payments '', even though my car insurance company issued them an over {$7600.00} partial payment for loss settlement. Even IF we agree to pay these RIDICULOUS additional charges, the service contract refund and the final payment from my car insurance company should cover the balance owed on the loan, with an actual refund to my husband. 

ALL I WANT IS THE DEALER TO HONOR THE SERVICE CONTRACT REFUND!!!! I do NOT understand why they are being so dishonest and egregious in this situation. WE WILL NEVER, EVER DO ANOTHER DEAL WITH NISSAN AND WARN EVERYONE TO DO THE SAME.

The agent who contact me from XXXX his name is XXXX XXXX and he referred me to LendingUSA to seek my loan as it close matched that I could be approved. I went to the site as directed by the email provided by XXXX and filled out the application. The following day I received an email from LendingUSA that my loan was pre-approved and they would need some verification before proceeding with the loan. I spoke with the representative, XXXX XXXX. I sent the requirements of drivers license, selfie + drivers license side by side and lastly a voided check along with an Instant Bank Verification ( they provided the link ) as requested per my conversation with her over the phone. I was approved and they sent me a link to complete and accept the loan. The terms were that the loan was at a 26.02 % interest. I thought that was great not as high as some other lenders. I was funded a funded the monies the week of XX/XX/XXXX directly into my account and payments to start paying back the loan to initiate on XX/XX/XXXX. I  started my payments in XX/XX/XXXX as I should and have continued making payments each and every month for this loan. However, today as I was making my payment for XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that the balance of my loan has not gone down. It was showing one month that it had gone down some but the following month I see I owed more than before. I called them today and asked them why my principal is not going down and they are saying that the majority of my payment is going toward interest and just a small amount is going toward the principal. The representative by the name of XXXX said that I'm being charged {$7.00} a day in interest regardless if I make my payment on time. I asked her then why did they say I would only be charged a 26.02 % interest if I'm going to be charged each day interest on a loan and if the average month at 30 days I would be paying about {$210.00} in just interest alone when my payment is {$320.00} monthly. She said it was included in the loan documents. I said I don't recall that and at this rate I'll never finish paying off my loan as scheduled as it will only be paying interest and not my principal because the interest rates are high and not the 26.02 % as advertised. All my statements reflect the balance going down then back up, no consistency of payments applied to the principal. I told the XXXX the representative that what's happening is predatory lending and I would be following up with my state and federal government of it's practices. Also, they make it look like on the statement they produce it states that Grace Period expires on the XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX   of the month for payment. So they statements are event deceptive in their writing of the statement to make it seem like there's a grace period to pay before you pay additional interest and fees. It is clear that any/all payments are made to their benefit only and at this rate I will never be done paying off this loan due to their deceptive practices and the set up of their correspondence/statements they submit to customers. Due to this I find them to be predatory lenders seeking only to rip off their consumers in the end. Had I known regardless I would be charged interest each and every day regardless and I would never get my principal down I would have not signed off for this loan. I feel fully taken advantage of. Everything was done online on their computer system. I was not offered the opportunity to print off the loan documents just sign off everything electronically. I made a follow up call after my first call today to request my loan documents be sent to me to review. I please ask for help. I also asked for their direct mailing address and this is the information provided to me : Attention : LendingUSA, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX.

2041,2019-12-03,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"This complaint is in response to the complaint number XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent an offer and HUD to SPS for a short sale review. SPS indicated the offer was too low, and sent us the appraisal which is for XXXX XXXX. We received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming the offer submitted was too low and we had a right to appeal. This property has been on the market over 400 days. If a higher offer could have been obtained, it would have happened. However, the buyer not only has to contend with the inferior condition of the property, but also MULTIPLE secondary liens, including a department of justice lien, and an execution that must be negotiated along with an order of conditions on the property. 

In the XX/XX/XXXX letter, acknowledging an offer from XX/XX/XXXXwas too low, it stated if we disagreed with the decision we had 30 days to appeal in writing. On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we sent three separate individual value information packets for dispute, each with their own cover letter identifying appeal information. The appeals included the buyers inspection report, our listing history information, sold comps, and much more. The following week XXXX XXXX called in and confirmed receipt of this package and we were told the information was in review. At the time we submitted the XX/XX/XXXX dispute packet, a complaint to the CFPB was initiated, outlining the flaws with the appraisal that was done in XX/XX/XXXX. With the CFPB complaint we included all of the value packets, which included comps, meaning SPS didnt review the attachments. 

XXXX called in again and confirmed the value information was in review. On XX/XX/XXXX, We received a response back from SPS via the CFPB. In this letter, they indicated an offer they received in XX/XX/XXXX was not high enough. They did not acknowledge the current offer sent to them in XX/XX/XXXX at all. They also further said they could not analyze the information we sent because it did not include comparables, however the XX/XX/XXXX information sent in DID include comparables. 

XXXX XXXX called in once again and spoke to the Ombudsmans office. She was told that because we didnt submit the comps necessary for a value dispute by XX/XX/XXXX, that the comps we did submit were not considered. Im not sure HOW we could submit value dispute comps on an offer we submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. Typically a servicer reviews all the paperwork and offer and lets you know what is missing or what else is needed. That did not happen. The moment we found out the offer was too low we submitted the necessary information to dispute it. In the XX/XX/XXXX letter it stated if we wanted to appeal we had to do it in 30 days which we did on XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX called in once we received the XX/XX/XXXX letter via the CFPB. On XX/XX/XXXX she spoke to the Ombudsmans office again, who at that time said they needed 3 SOLD comps within 1 mile of the subject property and dated within the last 6 months. On XX/XX/XXXX we sent them 3 comps. The were outside of the 1 mile area because even their own appraiser used comps almost 2 miles away from subject property, which is what we had to do, and we sent comps dated within 6 months of the original appraisal. We are now waiting for a decision. 

None of the above is proper servicing. We still have had no acknowledgement of the current buyers ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) offer. It is absolutely faulty servicing that an offer from XX/XX/XXXX still has not been acknowledged or responded too. They have also sat on value information for three weeks and have not responded, however managed to reset an auction date for XX/XX/XXXX while a file has been in review since XX/XX/XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",MA,1945.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3457217

I found that a new collection account had been added to my credit resulting from XXXX attempting to collect a debt. I closed my account with XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. I personally took all of XXXX 's equipment I had in my possession to the XXXX   store located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MD XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was prepared to pay anything I possibly owed but I was told by the representative that nothing was owed on my account, and I was good to go. They said that XXXX bills are billed ahead of time, and I was paid up. 

Fast-forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I received the notification from my credit monitoring service that a record from SOUTHWEST CREDIT SYSTEM was added to my credit report. Not recognizing the charge, I called them to find out that it was from XXXX. 

Prior to this notification from my credit monitoring service, I received NO notification that I even owed XXXX anything. I called them and they could not tell me any details. They just told me that I had an outstanding bill. However, they did agree that it was strange that this attempt came out of nowhere, almost two years later.

I have also purchased for several months-aggravating and unproductive- the Transunion monitoring for {$19.00} amonth. still nothing. I believe that someone is actively monitoring it because I keep looking for Mortgage information. I thought it curious that ex spouse refinanced his home two days before i purchased a car. I wouldve gotten the car sooner but the dealership could not pull my credit even with me at their own office PC and on their own phone trying to lift one freeze that I found was on all 3 credit reports.

Our loans are consolidated. Therefore, they are wanting to take my tax return and my ex-husbands tax return including his new wife 's income and base my monthly payment on that total income. I have spoke with numerous people and they quote me from {$500.00} a month to {$1000.00}. I am a single mother and have no means to pay that kind of payment. My credit score went down 43 points in one month due to my PHEAA student loan account balance increasing by {$100.00} from {$29000.00} to {$29000.00}.",,AES/PHEAA,OK,73159.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-01-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3503232
2148,2019-11-10,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"We had a business checking account ( Acct # XXXX ) with Bank of America to accept payments from our customers for advertisement services. On XX/XX/2019, we had a returned check of {$300.00} ( Check # XXXX, please see attachment for check image ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2019, we found out that our business bank account was locked. After visiting the bank on the same day, we were told the account was under force closure due to a counterfeit check deposited, which is the one mentioned above, the returned check numbered XXXX from XXXX XXXX. It's being handled by the Risk Department and they would not allow us to dispute or close our account before they close it and they were rude on the phone to the banker who was helping us to get more information on this matter. 

We also contacted our customer, check writer, to find out what really happened as to if it is really a counterfeit check?? And here 's what happened : The customer who wrote that {$300.00} check contacted his bank ( XXXX XXXX ) to stop the check because he didn't see his ad on the website the same day he paid, so he thought his ad was not on. Ads are posted one or two days after the ad fee is paid. So he called XXXX XXXX XXXX  to refuse payment without asking us first. The customer stated that a XXXX XXXX representative suggested to him ( over the phone ) to close the current checking account and open a new one, so the check # XXXX  will not get cashed. Therefore, the customer closed his XXXX XXXX checking account associated with check # XXXX. And that was the reason why that check bounced. Our Bank of America business checking account didn't show any problems until XXXX. Bank of America made the decision to close our business account without any type of notification to us, no email, no mail, no phone calls, no text messages, no In-App message, simply ZERO communication and notification. We must make it clear that the check # XXXX   from XXXX XXXX was NOT a counterfeit check, that check is genuine, it belongs to the customer ( XXXX XXXX ) and his mother ( XXXX XXXX ). It was written from the joint XXXX XXXX checking account in both their names. Please note, XXXX XXXX is our customer and owner of the business paying for advertising. The customer XXXX has said that he can talk to Risk Department of Bank of America to explain the situation, but Bank of America Risk Department would not give us any chance to explain. The banker at the local BofA branch told us, once the Risk Department made the decision to close someone's account, no one can do anything, their Risk Department is above all. The banker also said she has lost many customers due to this kind of force closure by their Risk Department with no warning to the customer. 

Furthermore, my personal Bank of America checking account also got force closed by the Risk Department on Friday, XX/XX/2019, it's really hilarious that my personal checking account is newly opened on Tuesday, XX/XX/2019, and there is no activity yet. I opened the personal checking account with Bank of America only for our customers ' convenience, otherwise, I would never want to open any account with Bank of America in the future. This bank is really using abusive and unfair business practices inconsistent with the American way of business and I am sure inconsistent with the principles of CFPB. 

Bank of America made an INCORRECT conclusion/decision after two months of investigation, that is so not professional, and we do not accept this unfair outcome. Bank of America lets a {$300.00} check ruin my and my companys credit, is this how they treat the consumers?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,91765.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3434559

The reinsertion in his consumer files by the CRAs of previously deleted items of information, unverified and uncertified for accuracy furnished by XXXX, as agent for XXXX  that Complainant is indebted to XXXX  to the sum of {$230.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rendered unto complainant on XX/XX/XXXX, unverified and uncertified for accuracy without notice to Complainant of the reinsertion by the CRAs within five ( 5 ) days of the reinsertion, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) ( ii ) and to b. Dispute the validity of the reinserted information as provided pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g, and in support hereof presents : 1.  As reported to the CRAs on XX/XX/XXXX, for inclusion in Complainants consumer files, XXXX, a third-party debt collector, on XX/XX/XXXX, opened a collection on behalf of its principal, XXXX, to collect a balance allegedly due XXXX  by Complainant to the sum of {$220.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rendered unto complainant on XX/XX/XXXX. ( See : XXXX Account No. XXXX ). 
2. Annexed hereto is a billing statement from XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX, which reflects a XXXX balance. As there is no balance due XXXX  for services rendered to Complainant on XX/XX/XXXX, there is no debt due XXXX  by Complainant or XXXX or other services rendered on that date and hence Complainant challenges the validity of the debt alleged pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g.

3. On XX/XX/XXXX, I registered Complaint with this agency against the CRAs for the exact same issue. See : CFBP Complaint No. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX. 
4. Upon reinvestigation it was determined that I was not indebted to XXXX  to the sum of {$220.00} for XXXX XXXX rendered on XX/XX/XXXX and the information was DELETED from my consumer files with the CRAs and remained so until XX/XX/XXXX. 
5. The only difference is that upon those complaints the third-party debt collector acting on behalf of XXXX was XXXX and XXXX and not XXXX. The fact remains, however, that the information furnished the CRAs regarding Complainants alleged indebtedness is the same information that was determined to be inaccurate and deleted from consumer files. 
6. As per the attached XXXX  statement, the same result is warranted : Removal from my consumer files of the inaccurate and disputed information of my indebtedness to XXXX to the sum of {$220.00} for services rendered on XX/XX/XXXX. 
7. At no time prior to XX/XX/XXXX did either of the CRAs provide Complainant with a statement that the previously deleted items of information were being reinserted into my consumer files, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) ( ii ). 
8. Additionally, ACA may want to inform its principal, XXXX  that in fact it is XXXX  who owes me. 
9. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Complainants primary health insurer was XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. XXXX Id. XXXX. 
10. Moreover, Complainant had secondary health insurance p XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of Texas ( XXXX  ), a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) organized and operating under the laws of the State of Texas, through its parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, with its principal place of business at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas XXXX. 
11. Primary insurance is the insurance that pays its portion medical claims first. XXXX  XXXX insurance is the insurance that pays the remainder of the medical claim. Medical claims are submitted first to the primary insurer and that plan pays out the maximum amount an insured is allowed. After the primary insurer pays, then and insured 's secondary health insurer helps to cover the rest, including co-insurance. 
12. At all times pertinent, XXXX was a participating provider within the both the XXXX and XXXX networks, meaning that XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  negotiated by contract the amount of payments that XXXX  would receive from XXXX and XXXX for services provided ( less plan discounts ) including XXXX. 
13. For the XXXX services provided on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX submitted a claim to XXXX to the sum of {$5600.00}. As per its contract with XXXX, the maximum amount XXXX allows for an XXXX is {$220.00}, which it paid, leaving Complainant with a co-insurance balance of {$200.00} 14. XXXX also submitted the {$5600.00} claim to XXXX. Less, plan discounts negotiated between them, XXXX paid XXXX the sum {$860.00}, which more than satisfied Complaints co-insurance balance of {$200.00}. ( As secondary insurer, XXXX was obliged only to pay the {$200.00} ). 
15. XXXX was paid by both XXXX, as primary insurer, and XXXX, as secondary insurer, in accordance with their negotiated payment agreements. Hence, as the XXXX statement reflects, I owe XXXX  nothing. In fact, it is XXXX  which received an overpayment of {$660.00}, which it actually owes me, and which I hereby demand from its agent, XXXX. 
16. The foregoing considered ; I respectfully request : ( a ) Reinvestigation to determine the veracity of the information subject to this dispute. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). 
( b ) SUSPENSION of collection activities with respect to the alleged debt, pending final disposition upon re-investigation. 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). 
( c ) Deletion from my consumer files the disputed information of my indebtedness to XXXX  as provided to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  consumer agencies by XXXX. 
( d ) Payment from XXXX on behalf of its principal, XXXX, to the sum of {$660.00}, for unjust enrichment for overpayment of a thing not due.

2299,2019-03-11,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"Thank you for listening. I graduated from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the late summer of XX/XX/XXXX after attending for 4 years ( 3 of those summers to graduate on time ). Prior to starting college, I moved out of my parents home and lived in an off-campus apartment. 

During my time with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I explained many times that I didn't live at home, but they could never help me receive any type of financial aid other than a couple of scholarships for {$250.00} or so, which I was so grateful for, but this didn't seem like the correct answer. I found myself in the financial aid office often because I had heard of students claiming themselves as independent from their parents somehow. If I recall correctly, there were some extenuating circumstances like the death of a parent and/or active military and some others. I was never receiving any help from my parents and their income was always considered, which left me with zero financial aid other than private and federal loans. I was the first of my family to attend college so they didn't know or understand how to help me further. 

I worked throughout all of my years at The University and paid about {$100.00} a month toward my loans as I could to help, but in the end, I'm not sure if it worked in my favor or not. I accumulated about {$60000.00} for my XXXX degree. 

For the first two years of repayment, I took advantage of the graduated repayment plan, which landed my parents around {$250.00} a month, then ballooned after two years to nearly {$500.00}. For several years, I paid between $ 6- {$700.00} a month through a few jobs, a divorce, a remarriage, and now as a mother. This debt can be debilitating at times leaving me feeling anxious and depressed, but also proud as I have overcome a lot and still maintained good standing. 

While the weight of my debt has been heavy, but I have always been grateful to have a job that helped me pay for my education. I know some have to choose forbearance for extended amounts of time or use income-based repayment plans to get through. I luckily haven't had to, but that hasn't come at a shortage of hard work on my end. 

Late last year, I consolidated my loans for a lower interest rate and to relieve my grandfather as a cosigner. I have always kept my loans up-to-date and this is something that has been very important to me. In refinancing, I was hoping to finally get rid of the rest of my debt. Now, inXX/XX/XXXX, I still owe {$14000.00}, I recently lost my job and I am at a loss of how to eliminate the rest of this debt without putting myself into more debt. 

I talked to my new lender, Lendkey, and my only two options are to do a forbearance, which is going to add interest to something I have worked so hard to keep in good standing or a refinance. I don't think at this time a refinance is an option for me as I have one of the lowest rates offered ( I have done a lot of research on this ) and I just consolidated my loans about 4-5 months ago. 

I'm reaching out in a desperate attempt that you may know of a program that I am unfamiliar with. As the mother of a young daughter, I want to set the best example for my daughter. I take a lot of pride in what I have accomplished and don't want to let my progress slip.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",PA,19601.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-05-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3643121

I walked into the TD bank ( located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Pa XXXX, phone : XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX to inquire about delinquent accounts with amounts {$130.00} and {$62.00} which were reported to the XXXX. I was unaware of such accounts until XXXX XXXX, XXXX when I walked into a branch bank Police XXXX ( located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Pa XXXX, Phone : XXXX ), to obtain a banking account and I was declined because of adverse Reporting of FRAUDULENT accounts to the XXXX. These accounts being:1. TD bank South Carolina : On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I opened a TD Bank account ( located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX South Carolina XXXX ) because I travel often, and I had TD certified bank checks that needed depositing ( void after XXXX days ). The TD checks were rental checks in the amount of ( XXXX-check number XXXX and $ XXXX-check number XXXX ). The problematic section XXXX tenant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, refused to resubmit payment amounts after informing her XXXX her TD bank did not honor their own Bank certified checks. The bank claimed the funds were returned to her account once voided, if not deposited within 90 days. 

This resulted in UNPAID PORTION OF SECTION XXXX RENT FOR XXXX XXXX {$70.00}, and UNPAID PORTION OF RENT FOR XXXX XXXX {$210.00}. XXXX XXXX, tenant paid {$34.00} instead of {$70.00} citing she had to purchase "" insecticide, weed wacker, and ant baits '', and she subtracted her purchase from Section XXXX mandated amount of {$70.00} for the month of XXXX XXXX. She refused to pay XXXX XXXX rental portion {$210.00}. She is a problematic tenant, files false police reports, is a false witness, and well known throughout the lawyer judge judicial system assembly. This problematic section XXXX tenant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is DELUSIONAL and wanted to dictate when I deposit MY MONEY. 

Again, TD bank branch in XXXX South Carolina would not honor their own TD bank certified checks. 

2. TD bank New Jersey : I attempted to deposit the checks XXXX again after diligently attempting to advise problematic section XXXX tenant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to resubmit rental payments ; however, she believed she could live at property : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Jersey XXXX free from XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( partial payment XXXX XXXX in amount of {$150.00} ) through XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I entered TD bank ( located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX via TD bank employee XXXX XXXX Phone : XXXX ), and the branch would not honor it 's very own TD bank checks. 

3. Property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX New Jersey XXXX : The security deposit paid by the state of XXXX totaled {$1800.00} and I deposited these funds into a high yield interest bearing account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted on several occasions to provide name and address of account information to problematic section XXXX tenant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, along with CASH annual interest payments and she refused ( I HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE ). 


The TD bank account was closed once the balance EQUALED XXXX. I ensured the TD bank account closed without any issues, and I resolved any issues with the account after I walked into the TD bank branch ( located at XXXX New Jersey XXXX ) to close the TD bank account. Again, the TD bank account closed with a XXXX BALANCE.

I declined the mortgage ( This is not the case ). While applying, I paid for appraisal services, and I ask the bank to transfer the appraisal to the new lender. Bank official refused to transfer it at the first place. I attempted to request this transfer from more senior people. I was provided with 2 lines of the letter ( attached ), no signature, no sign from whom, nor the indication and confirmation regarding compliance with AIR ; the letter was obviously declined by the new lender.

Once I asked Wells Fargo to provide the required letter, this stands thy follow AIR rules and regulations. They officially refused to do this. It means they are not in compliance with Appraisal Independence requirements, so appraisal report they ordered is not in compliance with Appraisal Independence Requirements. So I waster my money on the useless paper, which could neo be used by any lender and by the bank itself.

This is the report I paid for, and at this moment I do not have time to do another appraisal.

They refuse to take identity theft seriously, and refuse to follow all laws put in place to protect consumers, Equifax refuses to block the fraudulent accounts/ tradelines and refuses to assist even with law enforcement documentation that I have attached to previous complaints that they seem to ignore. Equifax shows Total open balances {$180000.00} Which is actually absurd. Most of these accounts have already been reported to Equifax as Identity theft Fraud. They were opened by true name fraud, using a fraudulent address and Equifax doesn't care nor wants to do anything about it. They do not block the fraudulent accounts, they do not follow LAW 603 ( B ) Even after they were sent law enforcement documentation, and Identification. They continually report the fraudulent accounts, Most of the accounts either show payments with "" No data '' Or "" Late '' When neither occurred as I never made payments on these accounts because they were opened by a FRAUDSTER. Equifax continues to refuse to assist with blocking the fraudulent account 's and continually damage my credit causing monetary loss. I am requesting Equifax be looked into as These accounts are on my FTC Affidavit which is a Legal Document, and Equifax refuses to look over this.

I do not have any of information from the money received nor sent. 
( I WANT MY MONEY BACK. ) I WANT MY MONEY BACK IN MY ACCOUNT NOW. I will be going to the bank TO STOP PAYMENT HAVING anything to do with cash app and going to my lawyer to sue FOR ALL OF THIS STRESS AND TO STOP THIS ( UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS ). 

It is now XXXX XXXX and no call back nor no contact with them through no telephone number listed on your site. 

They also took my old account down and I cant see any of my previous transaction I DOWN LOADED YOUR CASH APP BOOKLET OF 27 PAGES. # 7 PAYMENT CANCE3LLATION, STOP PAYMENT REQUESTS AND REFUSED PAYMENTS. YOU STATES : Our ability to stop a P2P payment instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized payment instruction will depend on how the payment instruction was initiated, and whether the payment instruction has begun processing. P2P payments not claimed by a Recipient for fifteen ( 15 ) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically. We will attempt to return any unclaimed. 

The problem with CASH APP is that it is not friendly users. You cant talk to anyone at all. THIS IS WRONG AND MUST BE TAKEN DOWN ACROSS THE WORLD. 

ANGRY XXXX XXXX I AM GETTING A LAWYER AND I AM GOING TO REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE AND ALERT SOCIAL MEDIA OF THIS AND THE WORLD AND FAR AS I CAN GO. 



I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW. 

RE : I want my money back. 

Dear Square, Inc. Licensors I am sending this complaint because CASH App STOLE MY {$740.00} ON XX/XX/2019. Attach please find the letter that I overnighted to SQUARE, INC./CASH APP LOCATED AT XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX , CA XXXX. 

During the conversation with supposedly have been a CASH APP service person ; they were stealing my money. I did go to my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) spoke to the Fraud Department. I completed the packet today XX/XX/2019 @ XXXX XXXX. The person that I supposedly talk to name he gave me was XXXX XXXX. 

I have read the 27 pg. Term of Service|Cash App. The Term of Service is not User Friendly. It has many loop holes for Square, INC/Cash App employees to steal customer money. The numbers Square, INC/Cash App give goes to an automatic message that does not help in the least. All of the number goes to an automatic message that cant help you. 

This letter will be received by as many of your Licensors of Square, FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I have already completed a Fraud Affidavit packaged at the Bank. I have overnighted this letter to SQUARE, INC/CASH APP. I have also sent a letter to the Attorney General Office. You Guys will not get away with stealing my money. 

The CONTACT CASH SUPPORT states on their contact cash support that you CAN REQUEST CONTACT THROUGH THE Cash App or cash.app/help but they lied NOONE WILL CONTACT YOU BACK AT ALL. They further stated on their TERMS OF SERVICE that you can call XXXX. When you call you will notice that ( current no phone number that you can call to peak with CASH SUPPORT does not work. OR you must request contact through the Cash App or cash.app/help. These directions are false and do not work. I went through the directions in contacting someone I received a message that stated that my complaint was received and I will receive service from them BUT nothing was done. I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW The money deducted from my account was not authorized and I want it back. Now the money that was taken came from CASH APP ; it is stated on my bank account with a number that does reach any one. The CASH APP does not allow customers to reach any one and when there is a complaint they promise that they would contact after an online support but they lied. 

PLEASE READ THE ATTACHED LETTER THAT ALL WILL RECEIVED.

But on the report it doesn't state why my payments were delinquent. I am always on top of my loan and debt repayments ; however, XXXX is an unreliable company which makes repayments almost impossible. My loans first became due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that day until XXXX of XXXX, I made several attempts to repay my loans by either visiting their website or calling them. Whenever I visited XXXX 's website I encountered a message claiming that "" service is unavailable ''. This happened every single time I visited their website. Since, repayments through website was obviously not a solution, I attempted calling the company on various days at various times. I would either receive a busy tone, or the call would keep ringing without anyone ever responding. To investigate this further, I called XXXX University 's loan and financial department, and a represintive went over different possibilities. They told me that XXXX often has these problems, and it is very like that they are changing the service provider for those loans, and I shouldn't worry about. That was a relief to hear as XXXX seemed very shady in the way they conducted business. Unavailable website and customer service can be very very alarming. This company has wasted a lot of my time from writing this complaint, calling them, visiting their website, etc. I shouldn't chase after them and waste every day of my life to hopefully catch their uptime. This is unreasonable. 

On XXXX of XXXX, I was able to access their website, and realized they are still handling my loan. Their website 's interface is not intuitive and errs on the simplest actions and inputs. Even with all these obstacles, the first thing I did was to setup ACH so that they could directly transfer money from my bank account. Again, this was the first thing that I did to prevent any delinquent repayments in the future. I believe the way that XXXX handled my case is absolutely wrong and bizarre, since they provided no medium for me to take care of my repayments at all. XXXX 's business is very concerning and suspicious. No transparent communications, no website, and no customer service. Even as I am writing this the website is unavailable. However, this time it doesn't even show any messages, the website just doesn't load at all. I have tried to load the website in different browsers and still no luck. I have attached the picture of one of the instances when I visited the company 's website to make a payment. This problem was so frequent, I took a screenshot.

They informed me that they do not offer that type of service and it is nothing they can do about the late fees. So, as of today, I believe I have two or three late fees on the account that are not really my doing and it is nothing they can do to prevent it. I just want some type of convenience or to have the late fees waived since there is nothing they can offer me to make sure I receive my statements by email on time or have payment automatically drafted.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report.

2505,2019-02-07,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX I called the Best Buy ( citibank ) Credit Card customer support to get a payoff amount, make payment and close the account. This was completed at that time, amount/payment made/closed account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Best Buy/citibank withdrew {$190.00} in autopay on a paid off, closed account. I called customer support immediately upon seeing this on my banks app. I was told then that it was a mistake and would be refunded within 10 days. 

No refund was completed so I called back, asked to speak to a supervisor and was again told it would be 7-10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I  received an email from Citi that the refund was being processed and should be in my account within 3 days. 

No refund appeared within the timeframe so I called again, they gave me a account number the refund went to which was not mine, nor the account the money had been withdrawn from. After advising them of their inaccuracy and reproviding the correct account number, I asked how and why this could happen, the account had been set up on autopay and the {$190.00} they withdrew was from the same account I had just re provided. Again I was told 7-10 days.

I called again the following week and requested to be transferred to the next level management as every answer was becoming 7-10 days.

Upon reaching the Executive response team, they agreed that they made the mistake both by withdrawing the money to begin with but also for refunding it to "" some other account which was not mine ''. I was told by that team that they had another 7-10 days to review and work on the issue. 

I received a call ( the first callback during this issue ) on the XX/XX/XXXX from the executive response team stating that the only issue left was for her to get verbal confirmation from me that I did not have an account ending in XXXX ( the account they sent the money to ), I confirmed and restate here that I do not have an account ending in those numbers. Her response was that she would rush that confirmation to the "" other office in charge of disbursements '' and to expect the refund in my correct account within 5-7 days. 

Upon yet again not receiving the refund I called today XXXX and again spoke with my executive account specialist ( XXXX ) XXXX, she advised me she had been given bad information and that they also needed to recover the money from the erroneous account prior to paying me back for their error. 

( I would like to reiterate that even today Citi confirms they made a mistake, they know I don't own the account they supposedly sent the money to, that they will not refund their mistake-my money until they get theirs back ). 

During this phone conversation which they record, my specialist also informed me that : 1. She now had a response date/iou to me to get back to me by XXXX. 
2. They/Citi can't/wo n't as a matter of policy refund me until they secure their money first.

3. They have no ability to find anything out about the account they sent it to as they do not know who owns it, nor can the receiving bank give out information without the account owners approval, but she has until the XXXX to get back to me, they sent the receiving bank a letter and "" I hope they can help ''. 

I requested to speak to the next level of management as I simply could not believe a company as large as Citi could do business in such a way. She told me the next level was the office manager but he wouldn't have access to my account. I said that was fine I would still like to speak to him. She then asked me why as he had no account access? I stated he didn't need to have account access, I wanted to ask him about policy. She then informed me that the office manager doesn't speak to customers. I found these actions pretty telling and is what prompted me to contact Consumerfinance.gov.

We are currently on day 58 of this process as of XXXX and the only difference today from XX/XX/XXXX is that instead of the past 7-10 response time promised, Citi has done 2 things, one upped the time frame to 21 days and 2 advised me they won't refund me until they get their money and they have no way to do that. Citi employees words not mine. 


Any help you can provide on this will be greatly appreciated as I see this as fraud on the part of Citibank/Best Buy Credit institution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MT,59937.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-07,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3145739

2519,2019-02-06,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Step 1 : What is this complaint about? 
There were 2 unauthorized transactions done with my debit/credit card on XX/XX/XXXX which posted on my account JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A ( checking account ) as debits on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amounts of {$240.00} made at XXXX and {$61.00} made at XXXX, form a XXXX store XXXX located in XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

Step 2 : What type of problem are you having? 
Per my bank JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A ( Chase ), the unauthorized transactions will be charged to my bank account without my consent despite the fact I have disputed the amounts with my bank. 

Step 3 : What happened? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail from JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A ( Chase ) notifying me that my debit/credit might have been compromised. I called Chase to find out why, and they said they will send me a new debit card. I was also told that I was restricted to drawing {$100.00} per day with my debit card and limited to {$500.00} purchases on my online transactions until my new card arrived. 

On XX/XX/XXXX when I looked at my XXXX XXXX bank statement, I realized the unauthorized transactions were made ( mentioned above ) and notified Chase ( submitted a claim # XXXX ). I reported to Chase again on that day that had received an e-mail form Chase notifying me on XX/XX/XXXX that my debit/credit card might have been compromised and they claimed to have sent me a new card but I had not received it. The card that was compromised and the new card which I never received were both cancelled by Chase and was told a new one was issued to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase to follow up again because the day I made the report, I was told to sign the report letter that would be e-mailed to me and send it to Chase, but I never got it. I logged into my Chase online account and looked at my statements and documents, but there were no letters or notifications about my report posted for me to sign. I called Chase to follow up and get the form, but I was told by the representative who answered my call that I didnt need to sign any letter. I was told it was not needed anymore. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Chase dated XX/XX/XXXX notifying me that they determined the transactions were authorized and they will not return my money. 

I called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX to reopen my case and asked Chase to do their due diligence and look into the matter since I did not authorize the transactions and was not present at the claimed location where the transactions were made XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. They reopened the case and it will take an additional 5 days for a final descision. I never received the new debit card that was supposedly mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX, Agent XXXX at Chase told me a request for a new card was never placed for me on XX/XX/XXXX as I was told by Chase that day. So, XXXX, in the fraud department said he would send me a new card on XX/XX/XXXX for the 2nd time. Step 4 : What company is this complaint about? 
This complaint is about my bank JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A ( Chase ), for an unauthorized transaction that was charged to my bank account without my consent. The bank is not doing its due diligence in properly investigating the matter or in protecting my assets. I was never at the location where the transaction was made ( in person ). Why cant Chase request surveillance video recording of the time and place from the XXXX store where the purchase/transaction was made? Chase is not able to provide me with a signed receipt of the credit card transaction, nor was the transaction a debit card transaction in which my pin number has to be validated. Chase has not shown me proof that the transaction was made by me in writing or in any other format. The only claim Chase has is that a card with my debit cards number was used at the location. That does not prove it was me or that I consented to the transaction. If my card was duplicated or compromised, Chase has the obligation to protect my assets. When I opened my checking account with Chase I was told my money was protected and that I was not going to be responsible for any unauthorized transactions. Why cant they do their due diligence and properly investigate?

2537,2019-05-31,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,,"My name is XXXX XXXX. The hardship started in XX/XX/XXXX when I was working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I injured my XXXX on 6 separate occasions from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. My attorney advised me to apply for social security disability. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a fully favorable judgement. Now, my earning potential is almost XXXX due to my limitations. I believe I was forced out of my job with the XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a loan modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who held both the 1st and the 2nd ( HELOC ). In XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for a modification for the first. My specialist at XXXX XXXX XXXX was XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was constantly calling her and asking to modify the HELOC. She repeatedly told me that they were working on it. XXXX XXXX XXXX still serviced the HELOC until XX/XX/XXXX. Ms. XXXX called me and said that the HELOC had been discharged and eliminated and that I did not have to pay it or worry about it but to keep my 1st in good standing. The last payment I made on the HELOC was in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXXI applied for Keep Your Home California "" principal reduction '' program. I was approved and KYHC paid {$43000.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX to lower the principal. This caused a second modification. 
Everything was going great until the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I received a recorded Notice of Default and Election To Sell via USPS from Specialized Loan Servicing, the new servicer of the HELOC. The Foreclosure Manager at the law firm representing them, Mr. XXXX XXXX, called me around that time to ask, "" Why has this taken 20 years and why are they doing this now? '' I replied, "" I don't know. '' After receving the NOD from SLS I called them and asked that same question. I told them that XXXX XXXX XXXX told me this was discharged. They told me that the HELOC was sold to investors. XXXX at SLS asked me if I wanted to offer a "" short payoff. '' I was scared and told her that I did. She said she would be mailing me an application and directed me to fill it out and to write an "" offer letter ''. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the application from SLS. I filled it out, wrote the offer letter and faxed it at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the office and a recorded message confirmed receipt of the application and documents on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have been working very hard trying to find out what exactly happened with the HELOC account. I have called XXXX XXXX XXXX numerous times regarding this. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke with a supervisor at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX who told me he would send me copies of transcripts regarding the history of the HELOC from XX/XX/XXXXthrough XX/XX/XXXX. I am still waiting. Two other XXXX XXXX XXXX supervisors are looking into this and agreed to send me the history of the HELOC. I have not received anything yet. I have called the HUD hotline and was told that since the HELOC is a 2nd, they can not help ( they only help people with first mortgages. XXXX has that same policy. Legal Aid will not get involved. Senior advocacy does not have the expertise to help. 
What's odd about this HELOC is that it does not show up on any of the 3 credit reporting agencies. My credit is : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I COULD qualify for a refinance, in order to pay SLS the {$40000.00} they say I owe. 
What is stopping any and all lenders from working with me is the recorded Notice of Default. I have sent Specialized Loan Servicing 29 emails to date and they have responded to Zero. I have left at least 4 messages ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) for my SPOC,  XXXX, and am still waiting for him to call. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, at this point, is not taking responsibility for telling me that the HELOC was discharged and paid off. They will admit that they discharged the HELOC in XX/XX/XXXX but they want to wash their hands of it. My 1st with XXXX XXXX XXXX  is in good standing, never late and no payments missed. ( There is an error with 7 of my payments when they received the $ XXXX payment in XX/XX/XXXXfrom KYHC ) I know I am rambling but sometimes I am able to write more consisely than other times. Sorry for that. 
I will try to wrap up this tangled web. I want to do the right thing. I made a {$20000.00} offer to SLS 3 weeks ago via email. I have not spoken with my SPOC in nearly a month. He will not return my emails or my calls. 
I do not want to lose my childhood home, which my father and his brothers built in XX/XX/XXXX. I live alone and don't have anyone. I can only depend on myself. I want to resolve this issue. In order to resolve an issues there are usually at least two parties. I have been trying to communicate with Specialized Loan Servicng for a month and have not heard anything from them. It's almost as if they are purposely avoiding me so that they can "" swoop in '' and take my home. And I don't want that to happen. 
So, I am sitting here making phone calls to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, HUD, Senior Advocacy, Legal Aid, Real Estate Attorneys, Bankruptcy Attorneys and the office of XXXX XXXX. I even left messages on the local television networks facebook pages. 
I also sent a letter to Mr. XXXX XXXX, CEO of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC. 
On XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX, I met with attorney XXXX XXXX, in XXXX. I paid the {$500.00} to retain him. A few days later he sent me an email which read, "" I don't have the time or the patience to deal with lenders '' and referred me to XXXX XXXX, a different attorney in his office. I met with Mr. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, after paying {$2000.00}. That day, he told me that it would take "" thousands of dollars '' to take this case and didn't want it. I got a {$2000.00} credit on my card for that. 
I am asking that Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, RESCIND the Notice of Default. That would allow me to get my home refinanced AND pay them the $ XXXX they say I owe. I have met with 5 attorneys so far and each one said that rescinding a Notice of Default is "" done all the time. '' I can see why Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, only has 1 out of 5 stars. They are HORRIBLE at communicating. They just don't do it. 
Being in pre-foreclosure or foreclosure is one of the worst feelings in the world. SLS should be returning phone calls and emails. I THINK they are just sitting back and doing nothing because they DON'T want to negotiate, they just want to take my home. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called SLS and left XXXX a message. I called back and dialed "" 2 '' to speak to the next available rep. Her name was XXXX. I asked about the offer letter I sent. She said, "" I can see that your offer was never even presented to the investors. '' That should never happen. Who's to say that the investors would not have "" accepted '' my offer? I called the attorneys representing SLS and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who if the foreclosing company. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, is a fairly new company that started in XX/XX/XXXX and is listed as a "" foreign '' LLC, based out of florida. I believe that only have one office in California. 
Two weeks ago, when I was speaking with a man at SLS, I asked, why are you foreclosing 10 years after I made my last payment? '' His reply was, "" We see that your home has enough equity to pay off the first, pay ourselves and then have money left over so THAT'S why we are doing this now. '' ( I can find his name in my file, but can't remember it right now and don't want to get "" timed out '' like I did yesterday. ) I called your office yesterday and spoke with XXXX, who was very patient and helpful. I don't know how to scan supporting docs right now and your website says that they will not be accepted later. But, he cleared that up. So, I will be sending you many documents to support this claim next week. 
The bottom line is this : I DO NOT want to lose my home. I am dong everything I can think of to communicate with the company who is trying to foreclose. They are not communicating with me. I will happily pay the $ XXXX that is written on the recorded NOD. HOWEVER, in order for me to be approved for any loan, the NOD MUST be rescinded. When that is accomplished, everybody wins. It's not that difficult to figure out. 
I am sorry this letter is all over the place but for the past 2 months I have been eating, thinking and sleeping this horrible situation. 
I hope you can give me some solid advice on what to do next. 
Thank you for taking the hour to read this.

2541,2019-08-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"I closed on my house on XX/XX/2019. I had been the official owner of the home for over a month and reached out to the lending company about a refinancing question, more specifically, when I would be able to if and when I wanted to. Only then is when they must have looked at my paperwork to answer my question, noticed an error in the documents and decided to let me know. If I hadnt have emailed them with the question, would they have even caught the mistake? 

The mistake : They sent me notice via email that they had made an error with the paperwork, over a month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, and asked me to sign new documents, again, through email. I had requested more information regarding the error and I was told this : "" Your loan included 6 % in Down Payment Assistance and that is provided with a 10 year forgivable 2nd loan. The lower Down Payment Assistance programs are a 3 year forgivable loan and unfortunately that is how your original second was drawn. The corrected note and deed sent by XXXX ( production coordinator ) is correcting your second from 3 years to 10 years to match your correct 6 % DPA. '' Mind you, I was notified of this information 30 days after my official closing date. I had already completed the signing process, made the final agreements to the contract and had been a home owner since XX/XX/2019. The company may have mentioned something in the beginning stages of the home buying process, and I know they mentioned briefly something about 3 years and 10 years. I don't even really know, but there was so many things going on, how was I supposed to know what anything really meant without it being explained in full detail? Everything made sense on my signing day, which is why I signed my name so many times. 

I did sign the errors and omissions document, which myself and others I have spoken to are completely unfamiliar with and maybe I should have asked more questions about it, but that is the partial downside of being a first time home buyer I suppose. I am a XXXX year old millennial and did not have the luxury of learning the home buying process in school. Regarding this document, don't they have to notify me of the error within 30 days of closing on the home? Am I obligated to sign this new paperwork that will completely change my 30 year contract? A little more information and to be sure I am understanding this all correctly, I used this first time home buyers program, which I guess acts as a 2nd lien, and when I went to my final signing to completely close on XX/XX/19 ( closing date was XX/XX/19 ), the paperwork said I was obligated to the 2nd lien for only 3 years and then it was forgiven. From my understanding, the mistake the lender made that they want me to fix now, through signing new documents, is that they want to change the forgiveness period to 10 years rather than 3 years. So essentially, I would have to stay in the home for 10 years and have that second lien in my name for that long ( vs the 3 years ) or I would have to pay back the first time home buyers loan I received.This changes things quite a bit. I am single now and the home has two bedrooms and one bathroom. I love the home, however, by the time I'm XXXX years old, I could very well be a different person and be able to afford other home options. This whole situation is scary enough and I just have too many questions I want answered and I have refused to sign the paperwork. 

Now, the lending company has sent me a letter, ( mind you the very first official letter that has been sent to me via mail regarding this issue ) which is dated on XX/XX/19. I did not receive this letter until XX/XX/19. The letter indicates more details about the error, that I signed the errors and omissions- compliance agreement on XX/XX/19 and that since I have refused to sign the documents and send them back via email that I am in breach of my contract. It instructs me to contact XXXX XXXX to make arrangements to sign the documents and that if I do not within 5 days of the date of this letter, ( letter dated XX/XX/19, received by me on XX/XX/19 : over 5 business days already ) that they will be forced to take further legal action against me. It ends with a warning, "" Please govern your actions accordingly. ''",,Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation,AZ,85053.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3332968

If you will not perform such an investigation, I will have no other remedy than to file a lawsuit against you. 

Enclosed are the police reports that i have filed and identity theft affidavits. Please investigate and remove these accounts from my credit report or I will have to refer the matter to my attorney and take immediate legal action against you. The constant judgments awarded against you certainly demonstrate that courts are will not tolerate your bullying tactics.I have made a lawful request of you to verify a report about me in my credit files. 

I respectfully suggest that you complete your investigation within the time period allotted to you by law, and in the event that you are able to verify this report that you supply me with the name, company address and company phone number of the person having verified the report and a full and complete report on the method you used to perform your investigation as dictated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

Bankruptcy. My debts were discharged in XX/XX/XXXX From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX my student loans ( serviced by XXXX XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX XXXX University ) went into deferment. In XX/XX/XXXX, I resumed making payments on my two student loans. I have always made payments on-time, both before and after Bankruptcy. Both accounts are current and in good standing. Days of delinquency are zero. Each account is open and has a positive balance. 

Equifax credit reporting does not accurately report my student loan accounts. XXXX XXXX specifically, for example, is shown to be closed, have a XXXX balance, and discharged due to Chapter XXXX. Bankruptcy. As anyone in the debt business knows, a student loan can not be discharged due to Bankruptcy. XXXX  reports my student loan information correctly. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have attempted to dispute the incorrect reporting of information on my Equifax credit report. Utilizing all of the proper dispute channels, Equifax has repeatedly come to the false conclusion that my student loan account for XXXX XXXX ( account number XXXX ) Has a balance of XXXX dollars the account has a positive balance Has a Date of 1st Delinquency the account has never been delinquent Has an Actual Payment Amount of {$0.00} the account has a positive payment amount Has a Scheduled Payment Amount of {$0.00} the account has a positive scheduled payment amount Has a Status of Account Included in Bankruptcy legally speaking, student loans can not be XXXX through Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy subsequently making Equifaxs language in the Status section overwhelmingly incorrect The remaining sections for this account on my Equifax Credit Report do not have any language, which is also incorrect. For example, as of XX/XX/XXXX the Date of Last Payment section should state XX/XX/XXXX as that was the date of my last payment for a total of {$260.00} USD. Another section left blank is the Type of Loan in which case, the type of loan is a student loan. 

Dates of Official Disputes & Dispute Confirmation Numbers 1 ) Dispute Confirmation # XXXX | Date of Dispute : XX/XX/XXXX | Date of Completion : XX/XX/XXXX 2 ) Dispute Confirmation # XXXX | Date of Dispute : XX/XX/XXXX | Date of Completion : XX/XX/XXXX 3 ) Dispute Confirmation # XXXX | Date of Dispute : XX/XX/XXXX | Date of Completion : XX/XX/XXXX While on the phone with the Equifax Dispute Representative on XX/XX/XXXX filing the most recent dispute, the Representative said that if I were to include a Loan Verification Letter from XXXX XXXX in my dispute via mail, then the information could be updated and corrected. I followed her recommendation and mailed the official XXXX XXXX XXXX Verification Letter to the stated address. However, upon completion of the dispute, my information was not updated or corrected the credit report shows the same inaccuracies prior to the dispute. 

It is known that Equifax records all conversations with Customer Service Representatives for Quality Assurance Purposes. Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Equifax requesting the transcript of the conversation made on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that, despite being verified through their system, I could not make that request unless it was in writing and I provided a copy of my Social Security Card and Drivers License. I was told that the request must be made to the office in XXXX, GA the same location that I sent the loan verification letter. 

The amount of sheer negligence paid to my credit reporting is reprehensible. By refusing to correct this information despite my documented dispute attempts, I have been penalized financially due to Equifaxs inaction. As someone who has started anew and attempting to rebuild a financial future, Equifaxs negligence is creating an additional and unjust burden. If I want to buy a home, for example, this inaccurate reporting damages my chances of securing a mortgage. If I want to propose to my partner, a company from which I would purchase a ring would see this information and either charge me higher interest for the purchase or deny my application all together. I have been charged extraordinarily high interest rates in other financial endeavors thanks to, in large part, Equifaxs inaccurate reporting. Their behavior has real world implications.

I noticed one of my two checking accounts balances seemed low so I double-checked the transactions. In doing so, I see 2 Quickpay with XXXX transactions on XX/XX/2019, one for {$1000.00} and the other for {$530.00}. I have never seen the names the money went to so I immediately called Chase customer service to report the fraud. They recommended me to visit a branch in-person to close the account. I immediately go to a branch to close my checking account that I had for 20 years and open a new one, to prevent any further fraudulent activity. Chase informed me that while they investigated they would temporarily reimburse the lost money. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 that Chase had completed their investigation and has found that the transactions were processed correctly or was authorized. Also that the funds that they had initially reimbursed me would be removed on XX/XX/2019. I immediately call the number listed on the letter in which the person I spoke with recommended I visit a branch instead. I return to the same branch near my house to dispute the letter. I go over the issue with the Assistant Branch Manager and she escalates the case with Chase Fraud Department. I asked Chase for the information that was used to determine my case and was told that they could not give that to me although in the letter, it specifically says that I could request it. Instead I was advised to take screenshots of my phone and laptop ip addresses and to email them to Chase Fraud Dept. The Asst. BM lets me know that it will take a few days for them to review the case but reassures me that she will keep me updated. 

On XX/XX/2019, Chase withdraws the funds as was indicated on the letter and I call the Asst. Branch manager to re-inquire about the status of my case. She lets me know that while they reopened the case, it was not possible to postpone the withdrawal and that currently the escalated case was still under investigation. She mentioned she would get back to me within another week to give me another update. 

As of today, XX/XX/2019, Chase has withdrawn funds from my account in the amount of {$1500.00} that was never authorized by me. Currently I am still waiting for an update and have reached out a few times by phone and email. I have not heard anything. 

I have been a loyal Chase customer for 20 years with 2 checking accounts and approximately 6 Chase credit cards. I requested them to review my usage habits as I believe it is quite evident in my behavior and reiterated that the 2 transactions were fraud. Absolutely incomprehensible that Chase would allow this kind of fraud to occur and then turn around and make me responsible for it.

Why are the Original Grantors not the same? Isnt the information suppose to match? 

I also asked my private loan carrier for A Master Promissory Note and I was shocked to find out that they have the same Promissory Note for my private loans that XXXX/Navient have for Federal loans for different schools. 

How is that possible? 

XXXX has told me on multiple occasions and by multiple employees when I have asked XXXX/Navient who my Original Grantor is ; there answer has changed atleast Twice, and now that I see that there reporting that XXXX is the Original Grantor. That's the third misinformation about this loan that they have given not just to me but multiple other companies. 

I have asked an employee and one of XXXX/Navient Managers for contact information to there legal Department. I was told that XXXX/Navient does not have a legal department. 

How do they handle lawsuits without a legal department? 

All conversations were recorded, I have had problems attaching them in the past, but if an email is provided I can submit those recordings Promptly. 

I hope someone really looks into this!!",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",TX,77073.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3232530

2606,2016-05-13,Debt collection,Medical,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : Notified of unexpected dip in credit. Credit Karma listed "" collection '' as reason. I had no idea I had been sent to collections before I checked my credit score! I called the agency listed as "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to question the collection. I was told that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received medical care from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' a company associated with a local hospital. I requested information and hinted that I wanted to dispute. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called my local hospital and doctor, both of which had no record of me being ordered or receiving care on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, let alone XXXX XXXX. I called "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to tell them that I wanted to file a dispute. The representative verified that I received service from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX according to their records. I was told that the {$180.00} was what was left after insurance paid their part. He said that my only option to receive information, other than that from his business, would be to call "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ... which just so happens to be bankrupt and without a valid phone number. I was told that I could file a dispute, and if my credit was still hurt, I could pay the {$180.00} during the process. After the dispute was settled, and if I was found correct, my {$180.00} would be returned to me. I was told the dispute process would take 60-90 days to be settled and that the process was started. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called my insurance, who searched their archives for claims. They confirmed that they did not receive billing for any services in XXXX XXXX. I immediately called "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to see where we were in the dispute process. A week had passed since I thought the representative had filed the complaint. The rep 's boss answered my call. He stated that the dispute was never filed, since I was questioning receiving care 3 years ago. I told him that it was my impression ( as well as my mother and father who listened and recorded the phone call on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) that the dispute was filed. The manager said that the rep. never filed the dispute and left a note that we might pay. The manager then clarified that we could not file and pay in hopes of being reimbursed after the dispute, which was new knowledge since the representative told us we could. The manager then said that the "" date of service '' ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) may not truly be the actual "" date I received care, '' which is another inconsistency from what I was told during both phone calls on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I alerted the manager to inconsistencies between my communication with the manager and what I had been told previously. 
Summary : The company never alerted me to being sent to collections ; I found out after my credit score was affected. I established communication with them first by calling them after seeing my score. I was lied to about the dispute process : the rep. told me it started and to wait 60-90 days. I called a week later ( 7 days into the 30 I had to file the dispute ) to find out it was never filed! I was lied to about the date of service. I feel like I was being coerced into paying since the rep. said that I could pay the {$180.00} while in the dispute process and have the possibility of being reimbursed if I am found to not be responsible for the debt ( which I later found out was a lie ). Had I never called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & waited the 60-90 days as told, I would have unconsciously admitted guilt and been responsible to pay. Had I paid the {$180.00} to help my credit during the dispute process ( in hopes of reimbursement ) I would have forfeited all money, since unlike what I was told on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, payment is admitting guilt. The inconsistencies among employers and communication with me, the client, is unfair business. Although the manager said the dispute process was officially started as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I will mail a written notice to assure the process has started.",,Midwest Recovery Systems,KY,41071.0,,Consent provided,Web,2016-05-13,Closed with explanation,No,No,1925472

2615,2018-02-26,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated an online money transfer of {$1.00} from my Bank of America checking account to a friends XXXX XXXX  account using XXXX and recipient using XXXX Quick pay. This transaction was as a refund of the money which the XXXX XXXX holder had loaned me for rent two weeks earlier ( also sent using the same online banking service ). The XXXX XXXX    holder had gone into a XXXX branch in late XX/XX/XXXX, where a bank official registered his email and phone number on the XXXX Quick Pay. 

After I made the payment, the XXXX XXXX  holder did not receive his money. I went into a XXXX XXXX to make a complaint and I was informed that it would take up to 5 days because it was my first time making a transfer to him. Five days passed, and the intended receiver went to make a complaint at his bank. There, he was informed that his phone number was unable to pair to his account because it was already in use by another XXXX XXXX account holder. Hence, the amount of {$1000.00} intended for him was deposited to a stranger who already has his current phone number registered. He was also informed that he could do nothing about it, and that only I, the sender could file a claim through my bank ( Bank of America ). I am a single mom, and soldier, who certainly can't enrich the life of a stranger who erroneously received money intended for someone else, or XXXX XXXX. We can only assume the stranger received it because neither of the banks disclosed the status of the funds. 

I initiated a claim through Bank of America ( Claim # XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have attached a copy of the result of the claim which states I should contact the other party directly for further assistance. I and the intended receiver have contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX multiple times but they keep evading us with privacy laws. XXXX states that they can do nothing about it due to some fineprint which was never issued to either of us when we registered for the online banking service. 

XXXX is doing nothing to help the situation. In the first place, XXXX XXXX  was part of the problem cause they helped the customer register on the Quick pay, and did not inform him after his phone number was not paired to his account. Bank of America in turn has reached out to XXXX twice and got nothing. The money is in XXXX, if XXXX can not get it out, then they should be held liable. Bank of America asked me to file a police report, which I did and nothing came out of it. The police couldn't understand why they should get involved in this when the banks should get it resolved. Also, some bank officials were also surprised at the unresolved situation, while others told me it happens but it is uncommon. 

Bank officials encourage customers to use the XXXX online banking app, and do not educate customers of the risk. There is also no visible agreement or fine-print available at sign up. If the customer is liable for errors, won't we all walk into the bank for funds transfer or use the regular online banking the requires account number and routing numbers? 

I hope that this can be resolved as soon as possible through your office.

2661,2020-07-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"In XXXX of XXXX, we began the process of refinancing our mortgage. We competitively compared our existing mortgage company, Bank of America, NA to alternative mortgage providers. Our existing mortgage company, BOA offered a significantly better refinancing opportunity. On XX/XX/XXXX, the closing company issued us a closing disclosure for us to review, specifically indicating the closing cost and the payoff of the existing mortgage. This was in preparation for our closing on XX/XX/XXXX. We reviewed the numbers and agreed with the statement. The date of closing, XX/XX/XXXX, the closing attorney showed up at our house, and we reviewed the closing documents together and they were the same as the XXXX. The payoff was specifically {$310000.00} payable to Bank of America, NA. ( BOA ). The numbers on the Universal Loan Application matched the disclosure ; in addition, on the Schedule of Real Estate Owned was the same as the above {$310000.00}. It is important to note, this schedule was produced prior to closing, so, at closing, we had further confirmation that the {$310000.00} was what was owed to BOA, NA. Towards the end of the stack of closing documents, there was the document entitled, Impound Account Payoff. I was requested to sign this without being given any information that the impound account was my escrow account. No where on any document, statement, or any legal document did it indicate how much, if any of my escrow money would be used to lower my loan amount. By not disclosing this to us, it made the alternative mortgage lender 's quote look considerably higher, because BOA was misleading us on what the loan value would be by lowering it with the use of our existing escrow dollars. We could never get an apples to apples comparison, which we are owed by the Truth in Lending Act. This also seems to be puzzling that BOA would use our escrow money, that was due to pay out property taxes in 2 months, to get us to refinance with them as opposed to another lender. Why would BOA, who did pay our property taxes in XX/XX/XXXX, with their own money, since they depleted out escrow account, if not to mislead us into using them over the alternative mortgage company? 
At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, one year after refinancing, we were sent a letter from BOA indicating a shortfall in our escrow account, and that we needed to pay them approximately {$5100.00} to correct the shortfall. I was completely taken by surprise because I have paid my full mortgage and escrow amount every month since owning this house. No where during the refinancing process did anyone from BOA ever mention that our escrow would be used to reduce the value of the loan, as opposed to paying off our property taxes and hazard insurance, as what it was prescribed for. Since being informed of the shortfall, I have spoken to numerous BOA employees who have agreed they can not find anywhere in the closing documents that escrow money and how much of them were being used to lower the cost of the loan. They have acknowledged and agreed with us on the actual numbers on our closing statement and there was no indication of transfer of escrow funds from the initial loan to lower the loan amount on the refinanced loan. I have since been contacted by an escalating agent who has flatly said I signed the Impound Account Payoff and owe the money. I find it puzzling that BOA would deplete the escrow money we are mandated to pay forward, thus making them responsible to pay our property taxes for the next year. That is illogical : the reason why escrow is set up is for the consumer to pay the taxes and insurance and not the bank. I believe the reason why we were not informed of BOA 's intentions was either a mistake on BOA 's part or outright fraud to secure our business for the refinance.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",GA,30080.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-07-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3750914

Mr XXXX sent a verified loan app from countrywide that states the loan app. Was for loan # XXXX one that I have not heard of. It states it was taken via phone and mailed XXXX XXXX to someone. The Loan was supposed to be for XXXX at XXXX approx a month. 
Then NOW ANOTHER FRAUD LOAN APP FILLED OUT BY XXXX XXXX and has the initials of XXXX XXXX as the signature ok to process. neither initials are mine ( XXXX  ) or my ex husband XXXX ( XXXX ) for XXXX XXXX at approx # XXXX a month.

Most importantly, Discover DID NOT DSCLOSE PRIOR TO applying and running my hard credit check that they will be requiring my tax returns release. if they had disclosed prior to taking my application that they have new policy of requesting release of consumer 's tax returns thru recently hacked Equifax, I would have never applied.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy which included that loan. The bankruptcy was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and the loan is being properly listed on my credit report as Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. 

However there is another loan listed on my credit report under XXXX XXXX. It was also reportedly issued on XX/XX/XXXX, with a last payment made date of XX/XX/XXXX, the exact dates reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX. This loan is being reported as Unpaid Balance Charged Off. I have never applied for or received a loan from XXXX XXXX, and certainly did not apply for or receive two entirely different loans on XX/XX/XXXX, as is currently claimed on my credit report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX merged with XXXX XXXX , XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX, the company became known as XXXX XXXX. It appears that sometime between the merger and the final discharge of the debt, the account was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, resulting in a new account number. That doesn't make it a new loan or change the fact it was discharged, however. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an online dispute with TransUnion, identifying the duplication and noting this was likely the same loan reported twice. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply claiming the accounts were verified as accurate. I'm not sure how it was verified, but someone, somewhere, is mistaken. 

I contacted the main office of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, to correct this error. I spoke with XXXX and explained the problem, and was transferred to XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch. After I explained again, XXXX told me that her manager, XXXX, was out of the office but would return my call the following day. On the XXXX, my wife spoke with XXXX, and explained the situation yet again. He stated repeatedly there was nothing he could do and claimed if TransUnion was saying it was verified, then it must be accurate. He suggested we contact an attorney if we had further questions. 

I am trying very hard to make sure my credit report is accurate and have hit a brick wall here. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my wife spoke with XXXX, I contacted TransUnion by phone to dispute their results and still have not received any indication that they are doing anything to correct this problem.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MS,39702.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3358029

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account. I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) you have on file of the accounts listed below.

We were ok with that and entered into a 75-day rate lock starting in early XXXX. We were attempting to refinance and do a second loan for cash out. 

We received an email from the processor in the first week of XXXX claiming the loan would be closed by XX/XX/XXXX. We sent every document requested immediately. 

After the email from the processor, we did not receive communication from anyone for weeks. We repeatedly called our loan officer and he never answered the phone or responded to our voicemails. We emailed the processor, loan officer and closer, all  copied on the email from XXXX, and nobody responded to our emails. 

XXXX comes, and we still have not heard anything back from the company about when the loan is going to close. Finally, the closer emails us and asks for more documentation that we provide immediately. 

The first loan appears as if it will close before the 75 day rate lock expired, but the second loan did not appear to be able to close in time.

We still have not heard back from our loan officer at this point and we decide we're going to go with a different bank and email everyone in the loop as such. Lo and behold, the loan officer calls and needs more documentation, which we provide without delay. 

Amazingly, Key Bank is able to close both loans on XXXX XXXX, meaning the funds and payoff should be delivered by XX/XX/XXXX. There was money due from us at closing which was something that our loan officer, processor or closer had not communicated to us. 

We close on the XXXX, but the bank did not pay off our mortgage servicer or pay us until the XX/XX/XXXX. When we were concerned about where the money was and why Key Bank did not pay off the holder of our mortgage, we called the loan officer again. He did not answer and did not return our calls until after the loan had funded on the XXXX. The processor, loan officer and closer also did not respond to emails and questions about the payoff being late. 

We contacted our previous mortgage holder, the title company and eventually the customer service line at Key Bank, and no one could provide any explanation as to why the money was not sent on the day it was supposed to be sent. We still do not know why Key Bank took extra days to fund our loan. 

We are extremely upset about the absolute lack of communication throughout the process and are filing a complaint so others know not to trust Key Bank when it comes to mortgages.

They required typical account opening information along with photo i.d . that I sent by using my phone to take a photo of the front and back. They also needed payment information for when I decided to do any transactions ( buying bitcoin or other such crypto currency ). I provided my banks routing number and account number. As of XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Coinbase saying I was ready to buy. I was able to log in to the pc with my username and password. Please take note that I was never asked to submit a selfie when opening up my acount ... just the drivers license ( this is not a critical issue, but makes a point later ). I then began to make purchases of bitcoin on various days until I achieved how much I wanted. I then took a short break. While I was on vacation XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX I downloaded the Coinbase app on my XXXX phone. When I went to login it then asked me for an authenticator code. I did not have this on my phone set up so I just decided to do what I wanted from my pc when I got back. The next time I tried to log in and see my account was the morning of XX/XX/XXXX ( Tuesday ).  All of the sudden the website was now asking me for an authenticator code. I tried to set this up from my phone, but realized that coinbase did not provide me a key to open it. Ok I thought, they have a customer service number so I can have someone just verify who I am and get me back accessing my account. I called at XXXX in the morning ( pacific ) and held until I talked to someone. The rep tried to talk to me about the authenicator, but realized we would have to go a different route. He said after I login I must click below the box on "" unable to submit a one time code ''. Then he said I must follow directions to reset my account. He then said it will go in for review and TAKE 48-72 HOURS to review. WOW! I am now locked away from my funds for 3 days minimum! Unable to sell if I need to? Never heard of such a thing. I asked to be escalated to a supervisor, was put on hold ... and then disconnected. I started looking up more about Coinbase and discovered many other instances of this. Decided the best thing to do was try and reset the account by going through the directions to reset my account ... ..even if it was 3 days, I need to do something. I logged back in and went through what the site asked for. I submitted a photo of my drivers license ( front and back ) and then it wanted a selfie from my webcam. After I submitted these it loaded and took some time, only to come back saying it failed validation because a photo was too big a file. It did not say which one. I could only assume the webcam one because I submitted the photos of my drivers license the same way setting up the account. I tried 2 more times to submit the photos while trying to shrink the file of my selfie. Each successive try failed for the same reason. I called the customer support again at XXXX ( pacific ) and spoke with a woman who said I should try using my phone with the XXXX browser. She talked me through the process. She said to use the camera on the phone from the site to take the photos. I tried holding up my drivers license in the photo box ( she said it will not use the rear camera ) and taking the photos of the license that way. I submitted and I was denied again! This time because the photo of my drivers license was not clear enough. I tried again 2 more times with her on the phone. Each time being denied for the same reason. She then said she will have to put me in contact with "" direct support ''. She said that they will email me and have me send in the stuff direct. I questioned her on whether I would get a call from "" direct support '' or I could call them. She said that they do not call direct for security reasons. That seems odd and terrible! I said ok, and waited for an email from this "" direct support ''. I did not receive anything but an email telling me what to do to upload photos. Decided to try and resubmit the drivers license and selfie on the website. This time after taking them it denied me saying I tried too many attempts and could not again for 24 hours. WOW! I then decided to call back at XXXX XXXX  ( pacific ). I talked to a man who told me he did see that I was to be contacted by direct support. He said I should receive an email validating that. I said ok, but frustrated with all the run-around so far. I did get an email from coinbase saying that the support would email me and the reviews typically take from 4-5 business days, but sometimes longer ( I attached a screenshot of that email ). I decided there was nothing more I could do but research more on who could help me. This is where I found CFPB. Decided to sleep on it and take it up today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Decided the first thing I would do is try again after the 24hours to resubmit the drivers license and selfie. This time I succeeded in getting the site to accept it. I now am waiting for the review and received an email saying it typically takes up to 72 hours ( 3 days ). 

Here are my concerns. They should addressed by coinbase : 1 ) Why was it so easy to set up my account without the selfie provided, but once coinbase received deposits from me and I got locked out, suddenly I have to go through many more challenging hoops.

2 ) It is unacceptable when a trading company such as coinbase has nothing better than a 3 day turnaround for clients who got locked out of their account. Ive worked for investment firms dealing with such matters, I have investments elsewhere, and NOWHERE is it like this. They always have someone available who can gain me access almost immediately. I am now waiting 3 days with money tied up in a speculative investment and if I get uneasy about owning I have nothing I can do. This is wrong! Also ... I still am not assured I will get my account verified. I will only get an answer in a minimum 3 days.

3 ) The tools to upload requested documents when someone gets locked out are awful. have directions on what the maximum file size can be. If someone is unsuccessful then there needs to be direct support who can call or be transferred to.",,"Coinbase, Inc.",WA,98042.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3236689

2746,2019-02-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake.

On XX/XX/2018 a driver struck my wife 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX creating a total loss. The lease was still midway thru a 3 year lease. After the other driver was cited and contacting our insurance company they directed us to contact ALLY to get a payoff amount so we could search for another vehicle promptly. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted ALLY financial informing them of the accident and requested the amount owed to ALLY for the vehicle so we could tell the insurance company. They provided us an amount of {$26000.00} was owed on the vehicle. XXXX XXXX valued the vehicle at {$30000.00} which would pay {$29000.00} after deductible. This made somewhat sense considering i put over {$3000.00} down on the vehicle on top of taxes and fees and we receive employee pricing with XXXX. We in turn had to immediately purchase another vehicle as once the vehicle is deemed a total loss the rental car is no longer covered. We took the amount ALLY provided us and used the {$3500.00} difference between that and what we would recieve from the insurance company towards another car. This is where myself and the insurance company are dumbfounded as ALLY would not give the insurance company a payoff amount. They said the insurance company must provide them with there payout evaluation so ALLY could provide a payoff amount. XXXX sent them the payoff amount of {$29000.00} and in turn ALLY sent them a letter of guarantee to release the title for the car for {$29000.00}. ALLY very conspicuously said there accounting department valued the car to the penny the same as XXXX 's payoff amount. We contacted ALLY notifying them of the error and this is where the predatory practices get really bad. ALLY transferred us to there total loss department. That department confirmed the payoff amount was {$26000.00} but once the vehicle is deemed a total loss it is there policy to collect the full amount the insurance company is willing to pay. I point blank asked them if the amount i owed them at the time was {$1000.00} would they be requesting the {$29000.00} from the insurance company and to my chagrin the female employee stated yes that is our policy. To be clear while leasing a {$35000.00} car whether you put XXXX dollars down or {$30000.00} down ALLY 's standard practice is not to accept what is owed to them it is to financially XXXX victims of accidents of the entire settlement amount to replace there vehicle. We have contacted ALLY with the insurance company many times and the adjuster is mindblown that ALLY wont give them a payoff amount and will only state they will accept the entire check for the vehicle to provide a letter of guarantee. I believe ALLY FINANCIAL is financially bankrupting, assaulting and taking advantage of consumers in there toughest times thinking these consumers will just take give in. I am more then happy to pay them what is owed which they confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to be {$26000.00} so all parties can move on from this but ALLY now will not discuss the matter with myself, XXXX XXXX or anyone else besides to say we sent a payoff letter and you can pay that. I have instructed my insurance company to put the claim on hold until this matter can be amicably resolved. But these predatory practices needed to be brought to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's attention so that the thousands if not millions of ALLY costumers aren't at risk of this fraudulent activity.

2778,2020-03-18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"Before I get started there was a case already opened, concerning this issue back in XXXX Id XXXX. At that time our investor WMC Mortgage Corporation, through the servicers XXXX   XXXX  held the second mortgage loan, on our home located here in California XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ca, XXXX. Their excuse back the was that we failed to provide, information requested by XXXX. This process went back and forth over the course of several years. They XXXX XXXX always claiming they never received requested documentation, which I sent on several occasions. 
During the course of our last communication in XXXX of XXXX, with XXXX  during the height of our once again attempting to negotiate, a modification, our second mortgage was then sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. 
Now lets step back, in XXXX, I lost my working as a XXXX XXXX, for XXXX XXXX XXXX My salary at the time was {$81000.00} per year. I was gainfully unemployed for, a period of 5 years. During that time period I was able to acquire part time and temporary employment. I did not return to full time employment until XX/XX/XXXX. 
During this time frame is when we fell behind on the second mortgage, from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX we were able to maintain our second mortgage payment. During this same period of time, the value of our home fell, to the point where we ended up being over {$200000.00} upside down with our mortgage. All along from XXXX thru the present day XXXX, we continued to maintain the payment on our first mortgage. 
In late XXXX we contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, requesting their assistance. The main goal in contacting XXXX was to obtain a Principal Reduction in our property value, to bring our property back to the actual market value. This was accomplished on XX/XX/XXXX. 
This brought our home from the original amount we paid for this residence {$430000.00} to the actual market value at the time which was in the {$200000.00} range. 
At the time we had no available equity in our home. 
After the Principal Reduction was place through XXXX, in XXXX the equity on this property began to climb. 
Now once the loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX To XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX immediately began the foreclosure process, since by this time period the property had acquired over {$100000.00} of equity. 
Mind you we had no idea that the loan had been transferred, as we were in the process of working out a modification with XXXX. 
Since acquiring the second mortgage we have been the victims of the predatory lending practices of our investor WMC Mortgage Corporation. 
Who have never attempted in good faith to try and offer a modification on this second mortgage. 
We have been forced to file chapter XXXX bankruptcy, in order to maintain residency here at our home located @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ca, XXXX. The only recourse XXXX has offered is 1. ) pay the rearrange of {$59000.00} or pay the entire secure amount of {$130000.00} Which include the original loan amount of {$82000.00} plus the rearrange. 
Now XXXX is charging a late fee for every months mortgage, not paid plus interest on the late charge, along with interest on the unpaid balance of the entire balance due on the second mortgage. 
As I stated these are unlawful predatory lending practices, in which WMC Mortgage Corporation should not be allowed to continue to get away with. 
Mind you WMC Mortgage Corporation themselves filed For bankruptcy protection in XXXX. 
We have been residing in our home now for 13 years and are taking all steps in order to continue to maintain residency in our home. We are represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX, who are working with XXXX  on behalf of WMC Mortgage Corp to obtain a reasonable modification. So far WMC has not budged on its demand to foreclose on our home. We are reaching out to you for your assistance in this matter",,"WMC MORTGAGE, LLC",CA,93536.0,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2020-03-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3570520

2826,2019-01-23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"We are filing this complaint against our servicer, RoundPoint Mortgage. We requested assistance with our mortgage payments due to unemployment, and was informed by RoundPoint Mortgage that we filled out a Uniform Borrower Assistance Form. We complied and returned the form on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage throughout the process. Later on, on XX/XX/XXXX, additional documents were requested by RoundPoint Mortgage by XXXX XXXX, and they were faxed to her on XX/XX/XXXX. We received an "" Evaluation Summary '' dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that we had been approved for FHA 's Making Home Affordable Modification program. In addition, RoundPoint Mortgage included paperwork with these forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, for a letter of agreement for a trial period of 4 payments in the amount of {$1500.00}, due on the XXXX of each month starting XX/XX/XXXX, and ending with the 4th and final payment of the trial period on XX/XX/XXXX. The letter requested that we sign if we agreed to the terms sign and return the forms by XX/XX/XXXX, and we did sign them on XX/XX/XXXX, and returned the forms the same day. The payments were made according to the terms for the entire trial period. We called to speak with our "" point of contact '' ( XXXX XXXX ) until we couldn't reach her any longer and had to settle for "" the next available agent '' on a regular basis to get an update to the finalization of the modified loan agreement. We continued to receive billing statements that we were behind on our mortgage, but when we would call in about the statements, many times we would reach XXXX  and he would tell us not to worry about the statements, and that they would be corrected when RoundPoint Mortgage finished "" updating our account '' with the information from the documents they had received from us, and that we were to continue to make the modified payments of {$1500.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a XXXX  envelope from RoundPoint Mortgage with the "" Loan Modification Agreement '' for us to sign and have notarized. We signed the forms, had them notarized and returned them via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage for updates to the finalization of the "" Loan Modification Agreement. '' We received forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, about a week or so later, stating that we would find "" a fully executed copy of the Loan Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX. '' We continued to contact RoundPoint Mortgage about our account not being updated, and when would the account reflect the new terms. When we reached the next agent available, again it would be XXXX  sometimes, and he stated like others before and after him, that we should ignore the billing statements and that he sent an "" escalation request '' to his manager, supervisor or someone in that capacity. This continued through XXXX, XXXX and then in XXXX we received a letter stating that we were behind two months in our mrotgage payments. I called, XX/XX/XXXX, and was connected to XXXX. I believe it was at this time that XXXX  told me that there was a new modified payment and that there was a shortage in payments for the XXXX and XXXX   mortgage payments. Since I was still paying {$1500.00} instead of {$1500.00} according to him, there was a difference of {$26.00} for each of the two months in question. We paid the difference of {$52.00} to bring the account back up to date. I also asked XXXX   why was it taking so long to correct the statements. I stated that I felt that someone dropped the ball, but he said instead that no one dropped the ball on either end, but that there were a few things that needed to be updated. It was wasn't until about a two weeks later that XXXX told me that it had been a mistake ( s ) made on their end, ( RoundPoint Mortgage ), that was the cause of the stall with the updating of our account. In addition, XXXX  stated that we need to keep making the modified loan agreement payments of {$1500.00} and he was noting the account.

Then around the second week of XX/XX/XXXX, we receive a phone call from RoundPoint Mortgage about a lien being on the home and this is what was an issue, and that we needed to fill out a "" Non-Identity Affidavit. '' We did on XX/XX/XXXX and mailed and/or emailed it back with the requested proof from court to verify that there was a mistaken identity issue, and sent both documents back to RoundPoint Mortgage the same day. We continued to stay in contact with RoundPoint Mortgage on a bi-monthly basis and it was almost a month after they asked us to give them two weeks to get everything in order, that they tell us when we call in XX/XX/XXXX, that they sent in another "" escalation request. '' The representative stated that they were making a note on the account, and to continue to make the modified loan payments of {$1500.00}.

Recently, we received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX from RoundPoint Mortgage that we have been granted a "" Loan Forbearance Plan '' and that we are behind {$9900.00}. It included a request for us to sign the Forbearance forms and return by XX/XX/XXXX. We signed and returned the forms on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a representative that told me we had to pay the late payments and the new mortgage amount of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, even though we were offered and accepted a Modified Loan Agreement in XX/XX/XXXX, and it was recorded with the county in XX/XX/XXXX.

We were given the excuses of an "" early payment during the modified payment schedule '' and that "" the debt wasn't reaffirmed before the debt was discharged '' as to why the modified loan agreement was, with no prior explanation prior to RoundPoint Mortgage finalizing the Modified Loan Agreement back in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXXwith the county.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation,TX,75115.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3131213

2885,2019-08-22,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Indicated you were committing crime by not paying debt,"I called into Franklin Collection Services in XXXX Mississippi on XX/XX/XXXX. I called because I saw on my credit report that they reported the same delinquent account 6 separate times to my credit report. The dates areXX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. The amount of the debt reported is {$430.00} and the original creditor is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The address that was on file with them was an old address so I gave them all of my updated information. I explained the reason for me not knowing that the debt was owed and that I was calling to get it resolved. I asked for a verification of debt letter, and I that I would gladly pay the debt in full and wanted to know if they could delete all the reports to the credit bureaus considering the situation. I also asked why the same debt was continually being reported just days apart, and I was told XXXX XXXX XXXX lets them re-report the debt every 3 days. These continuous report dropped my credit score dramatically, over 100 points. All the while, I didnt know about the debt because they didnt have my correct info. XXXX XXXX was the representative I was speaking with that night, XX/XX/XXXX. She told me she would call me back the next night to confirm with me that the letter was sent out to the correct address. The next night I received a call and missed it but called right back at XXXX pm, and the date was XX/XX/XXXX. I dont recall if if XXXX said the letter went out or not because the conversation escalated rather quickly. She told me her supervisor said that if I paid the balance in full they would remove it from my credit. I asked if I could get a letter mailed stating that they would follow through on that agreement, and at that point they become very ugly. From this point forward the rest of the call was very combative. They refused to send me anything about the agreement in writing which was a big red flag for me. I told them that I have learned that if its not in black and white it didnt happen. XXXX started telling me that I was going back on our deal, but still to this day, we have not come to any agreement. She was saying that I had wasted her time because I wouldnt pay them right then ( I had not received the verification of debt letter, so at this point I didnt know if this was a legitimate debt or not ). The rest of the conversation is kind of a blur as to who I was speaking with because it was a loud aggressive tone from their end, but I was transferred to two other people, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. Between XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, I was told that had to pay them right then or they wouldnt deal with me at all. They were demanding I give them a check over the phone or card information right then. I kept trying to tell them that I had not received the verification of debt letter yet, but they would not acknowledge that or even give me enough time to get it out of my mouth. They just kept telling me that they dont send the terms of an agreement before before they get paid ( big red flag for me ) and that I just dont want to pay they because Im not getting my way. At one point I was told that they used to mail the agreements out to consumers but dont any more because consumers wouldnt pay them after getting the agreement. Then I was told that it had alway been their company policy to never give consumers a written agreement. Now for the lie, The last person I spoke with, XXXX I believe, said that it was illegal for them to send a written agreement before being paid in full. They kept saying they can send the agreement after I paid them. I asked if it was company policy or illegal because the last person said it was company policy. I was then told it was illegal because the fair credit reporting act said that it was illegal. He kept saying that it was illegal and they wouldnt send me an agreement because it was illegal, and they dont do anything illegal. The person I believe to be XXXX not only was lying to try to get me to pay them right then, but talked to be like a complete dog, belittling me, and would not let me say hardly anything at all. I attempted to tell him several time the situation and that there was no agreement yet, and that I had not received verification of the debt, it was all him practically yelling through the phone. I finally got to the point that I was done speaking with them and said thank you for your text me and hung up the phone. XXXX called me again the next day and asked if I had tried to call her that morning, and I said no and we got off the phone. I received another call from them today, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX  and missed the call but called back at XXXX. On this call they told me that if I pay half then they would send me the agreement but wouldnt delete it from my credit until the other half was paid. I am not sure of this persons name. When I asked about the last call me being told that because of the fair credit reporting act it was illegal to send a written agreement, the question was side stepped and I was to that they dont delete anything, that they were doing me a favor. Once again there was not an agreement reached because I couldnt get a written agreement before making payment and at this time I still have not received the verification of debt letter. I told them that I had not gotten the verification of debt letter yet, so wasnt willing to make any payment until I received that and the written agreement. I also told them that since they were unwilling to send the agreement, I had to go with my safest option, calling the original creditor and trying to arrange payment with them so that the collection agency would have to delete the because because they had not rights to the debts. They didnt seem happy about this and told me that I couldnt do that because the creditor wouldnt pull the debt back. They then terminated the call. During the calls, I told them that I needed a written agreement so that I could hold them accountable for their end and they said they would have to hold up their end because the calls were recorded. I told them that I didnt have the ability to record the calls, so that didnt really do me any good. The reason I asked for the agreement in writing is because I dont actually trust that they will follow with the deletion once being paid. Being told that I can get the written agreement after I pay them sounds like a complete scam to me. The last time I was told I get the agreement only after paying was from an extended car warranty scam. The names given in this statement are names that XXXX XXXX from Franklin Collection Services gave me to night after the original call was terminated and I called back in to get the names of the people I have spoke with.

2929,2018-02-08,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"XXXX In XXXX my family and I moved back to XXXX from XXXX I had been hurt while performing duties as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and moved back to my home state. The injuries generated, and were further aggravated, from initial military injuries that I received while deployed to XXXX in XXXX. 
My family and I lived in two different homes after our move to XXXX. Both of those homes where serviced by XXXX XXXX using their budget billing process. During the service years from XXXX through XXXX I had no problems with XXXX XXXX and all bills where paid on time. 
In XXXX my family moved to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. We transferred our XXXX XXXX   policy to this address. XXXX XXXX services this home through XXXX XXXX. In the winter of XXXX we had a house fire and suspended our account until approximately XX/XX/XXXX for this address as the home was being rebuilt. When we moved back into the home in XXXX we again started the budget billing process for our propane usage. 
When we restarted our account with XXXX XXXX  in the fall of XXXX fuel prices where very volatile. Prices were going up, so my wife and I were concerned that we would not be able to have an escalating propane bill because of my injury status and being on a fixed income. My wife and I went to the manager at XXXX, in the XXXX office, propane and asked them if they could fix our price so that we would have the same bill every month. We told the lady that if we could not come to some type of agreement we would be forced to consider other options for a carrier as the price of propane may become too expensive for us. 
After having this conversation with the manager at XXXX XXXX in XXXX she said that she would consider options for us. Approximately a week later she contacted me and told me that management had looked at my account and said that they would deliver propane to my address for a flat fee of {$2.00} a gallon due to my use and account history. My family agreed to this fee and remained with XXXX XXXX 
In the spring of XXXX I woke up one morning to a very cold house. I built up the wood stove to get things warmed up for my family and then started to research why everything was so cold. I found that the propane tank was completely empty providing no heat. 
I called XXXX XXXX to inquire why my tank was empty because I was on budget billing and the tank should have been monitored monthly and kept full. They sent XXXX XXXX out to look at the tank and fill it for us. When XXXX arrived, he was very apologetic. He stated that he had not been tracking our tank for several months as we had not used propane very much for years. My primary source of heat was wood so the only thing the propane was used for was the cook stove. XXXX XXXX stated that he stopped monitoring our tank months earlier because we were never showing any use. 
I informed him that over the winter I had my XXXX mother staying with us and I needed to keep the house at a move even temperature and was using the propane as a secondary source to do so. XXXX had his safety people come and do a safety check on the line and then he filled up the tank. 
The supervisor at XXXX XXXX  called us to apologize for the lack in service and offered to give us a cut rate on the propane in the tank. So, she computed the usage for the amount filled, subtracted what I had paid, and then gave me a further deduction for them not servicing the tank on a regular basis. My mother paid the account in full through her checking account because the propane was being used primarily for her. 
Approximately two weeks later I was contacted by XXXX XXXX. The man stated that we did owe a further bill on our account. I was mystified. How could I owe you if we paid our budget billing and then satisfied the account once they had refilled our tank due to there lack of service. He stated that the lady that managed the accounts was billing us at the 2.10 rate and then was keeping a side ledger, off the books, of overages. I told the individual that I could not make any sense out of what he was talking about. We had always paid our bill on time. Our tank ran empty and then we paid that bill in full when the tank was made full again. 
He stated that the other manager did not have the authority to give us a contract for the 2:10 rate and because she had done so, to keep our services, she maintained a side account that showed an overage. My wife and I told him that we would come down to look at what he had. When we arrived at XXXX the gentleman told us we owed his company funds. At that time, we asked to speak with the lady that gave us the contract. He informed us that she had been fired. We asked to see our contract with our signature. He informed us that they could not find a contract with our signature giving us the rate of XXXX. We then asked to look at the side ledger that was being kept and he refused to let us see the document. 
I informed him at that time that I would not pay any further on the account until he could show me proof that the money was owed. I wanted the contract, to speak with the lady who gave us the contract, and I wanted documented proof of the side ledger. He refused. My wife and I left the building. 
We contacted XXXX XXXX and hired them for our propane services. We contacted XXXX XXXX  to have their tank removed from our property, they complied. XXXX XXXX XXXX the property until it was sold in XXXX. 
Over the following two months after the removal of the XXXX XXXX tank XXXX sent us a bill for the overage on the account. Each time my wife and I went to the XXXX building in XXXX and asked to see our contract, speak to the lady that gave us the contract, and see the side ledger for the overage. Each time the contract could not be found, and we were denied our other two requests. We informed XXXX at that time that we would no longer be dealing with them and that all accounts were satisfied and paid in full according to us. XXXX no longer sent us a ledger. 
We moved from the residence on XXXX XXXX to XXXX, Idaho in XXXX and sold the home on XXXX XXXX in XXXX. During that time XXXX XXXX had no further contact with us about the issue. We figured that matter was closed. 
In the fall of XXXX as we were contracting to move back into a home in XXXX  we were contacted by a collections company about a bill for XXXX XXXX from XXXX. We had no accounts with XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX in XXXX and asked them why I was receiving a bill from a collections company. The lady stated that the company had been reviewing old accounts and ours came up as past due so the bill was sent to collections. After speaking to her about the history of the account I again asked for the missing contract, the ladies name and contact information that gave authorized the contract, and proof of the side ledger. She could not provide those documents. I Informed her that we would not be making any payments on an account that had been satisfied in full on the day XXXX came up to fill the tank after letting it run dry. I asked that the company foreclose on the account and take me to court to speak to a judge about the account. 
I contacted the collections company and informed them that I was disputing the account. I had no account from XXXX in XXXX. I contacted the credit monitoring companies and disputed the account. I asked The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Spruce XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify this account and send me the contract and all information to prove this debt within the thirty day window to dispute the account. Nothing was ever sent or received by me. 
At this time the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account is being shown on my three credit report files as late past due since XXXX. Several companies have denied me credit for purchases and I have received higher credit amounts for accounts that I have opened due to XXXX showing a false account on my credit reports. XXXX refused to foreclose or provide documentation as requested for this matter. 
I have contacted both XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX several times about this matter. Each time I have asked for proof of this debt but have been denied. The account is showing it is from XXXX instead of XXXX. No contract, side ledger, or information from the manager that issued the contract has been sent to me. The new manager at XXXX stated that the old, fired manager, did not have the authority to enter into the contract that she made. She was their agent and I entered that contract in good faith and was never late on a payment to XXXX for my budget billing process. 
This account balance is fraudulent and the XXXX balance was paid in full at the time I fires XXXX XXXX for their lack of service and contract discrepancies. I would like the Consumer Trade Commission to assist me in clearing this matter from my credit history.

2990,2019-11-27,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"in XXXX we received a mailer about refinancing our FHA loan. We called New American Funding and Spoke to XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX. During our conversation he asked what we were trying to accomplish and we stated we were looking to get the PMI removed. He then told us if we refinanced with them and made 6 on-time payments, we could call him and he would drop the PMI as he had done for many other customers of his. This is the only reason we chose to use this company. There was no other discussion on how it would happen, it was just call me in 6 months and I'll get it removed. So we refinanced with them and contacted XXXX again XXXX via email about dropping the PMI. He asked some questions about income and possible value of our home. I gave him the information and now he said well we ( my husband and I ) would have to pay for an appraisal and he cant just drop the PMI. We explained what our original conversation was and he said he didn't know why he would ever say that because that is not what happens. My husband and I were quite clear and on the same page as this is what XXXX promised. I wanted to converse with him via email so things were in writing but he never responded via email, he only kept calling me. 
After about a week, I spoke to my in-house mortgage guy XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX  as I am now a realtor. XXXX advised me to file a complaint with the company. I did and complaint XXXX approx. XX/XX/XXXX and was assigned XXXX XXXX. XXXX told me he would follow up in one week after he was able to review the recordings and determine what was happening. I did not hear back from XXXX so I called his office and left a vm around XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a call back so I called again XX/XX/XXXX and got his vm again. instead of leaving a message I called a main number to try to find out what was going on. A lady took a message and XXXX called me back. He said he was told by IT there were no recordings they could find. XXXX said he would try one more time but he was meeting with his SVP that afternoon and would contact me by XX/XX/XXXX to let me know the outcome. Then I received an email later that night saying he was able to get the recordings ... sounded suspicious considering for an entire week IT could not find any recordings. there was no explaining of to how all of a sudden these recordings now existed. but I was glad they did. 
On XXXX we get an email from XXXX : Good morning Mr. and Mrs. XXXX, Our IT Department was able to provide the recorded calls between Mr. XXXX and XXXX and I was able to listen to the call where the conversation with XXXX XXXX takes place regarding the mortgage insurance. 

The conversation starts off like a regular sales call and when it gets to the part of MI being discussed, XXXX begins to explain how he will receive notifications on files he has worked on, after a certain amount of monthly payment are made. 
It was in this part of the conversation where XXXX explains says, when you make your 6th payment, I literally get notified saying, hey call up XXXX and XXXX and see if we can remove mortgage insurance with Mr. XXXX replying, Ok. 
XXXX goes on to explain other refi options, including going to a 15year loan to save money, long term, where Mr. XXXX makes it clear the focus would be reducing the monthly payment by removing the mortgage insurance. 

Having said that, the only option to have the mortgage insurance removed, would be to have you refinance into a conventional loan product once you believe the value is high enough. 
If this is an option you would like to pursuit, my SVP has agreed to reimburse you the appraisal if and when the loan funds. 

We apologize for the misunderstanding and hope were able to assist in trying to meet your goal of having the mortgage insurance removed with the refinance option previously mentioned. 

XXXX what they forgot to mention was the proclamation XXXX made about being able to do this for many other clients. and other important information they missed. I requested a copy or to be able to listen to the portion of the recording since it is me and my husband on the call, but they said I would need a subpoena. that made me even more leery. 

They have offered to pay for an appraisal however if the home does not appraise for the value they expect, they will not remove the PMI. I have been advised there is something called Vendor Paid Mortgage Insurance which they could do. But they ignore me every time I bring it up and change the subject. I gave all this information to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and he was shocked at their response. He advised me to file with the CFPB. If we were not told New American Funding would remove our PMI after 6 months, we would have never financed with them.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"BROKER SOLUTIONS, INC.",PA,18041.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-27,Closed with explanation,No,,3452861

It was an exceptionally busy time but the payment for this month was submitted a few days before the 30-day exception. ( See attached documentation ). As a small business owner, it is imperative that I maintain a flawless credit history as it could jeopardize my livelihood and more importantly the livelihood of my employees should I not be able to gain necessary funding for my business when the time arises due to a late payment destroying my credit rating. I fully respect the obligations I made to XXXX XXXX as with all the creditors who extend me financing opportunities and I have worked my entire adult life maintaining a great relationship with my creditors and I intend to maintain a great relationship with XXXX XXXX as I am in the market for a new car. A brief look at my account will reveal I have successfully made every payment up to and beyond the reported XXXX and XXXX timeframe which I can prove is in error ( See attached highlighted documents ). 
I understand that the monthly billing cycle is a 30 day billing cycle as described in/by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) my loan is financed on such a cycle that runs from the XX/XX/XXXX to the XX/XX/XXXX of each month, with that being said my payments were made within the limit of the following due date before the XX/XX/XXXX of the each of the reported late months as shown in the attached statements. Under the XXXX, a creditor must credit all payments to my account on the date they're received, unless no extra charges would result if they failed to do so. I understand that XXXX XXXX is permitted to set reasonable rules for making and reporting payments, like your rule that the deadline for payment should be received to be credited on the same date no later than XXXX XXXX on the due date. My payments were made on the day before and before the XXXX window. 
Again, the reported late in XXXX and XXXX payment are negatively affecting my chances of obtaining much needed lines of credit and business banking opportunities that are vital to the success of me as an individual and my company. As you know, my personal FICO score is used in the decision-making process of all business bankings go/ no go decisions to fund and my FICO score has drop over 45 points due to the late payment reported in XXXX and XXXX which pushes me out to tolerated range of lender preference. 
I am requesting that you please the reporting error and restore my credit rating by revising the late payment as reported on my three major credit bureau files ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ). I sincerely hope XXXX XXXX XXXX believes in their customers and I humbly request the correction be made. I have reestablished automatic payments so there is no doubt in payment dates.

Specifically, failed to validate a debt as I requested, which is a Fair Credit Billing Act violation. There has been continued charges, added interest and fees which are to be suspended until resolution has been found. I am seeking a reasonable resolution to this situation. Their lack of response for mutual negotiation or the validation of this account, has not been completed. Not only have they ignored my prior requests for validation of the account but continued to contact me through means of robotical debt collection calling. This account is to be updated as disputed or to be deleted from the credit reporting agencies due to the damage to my character during this account dispute. I am intending on filing the disputes with the consumer regulatory bureaus and state attorney 's office. They are willfully violating the Fair Credit Billing Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act for the purpose of causing harm. The continual stress of harrassment, damage to credit report, and the collection efforts must stop until a reasonable resolution is found. My requests for validating accounts were ignored, I have never received any response from them to validate accounts. They failed to maintain reasonable procedures in their operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports they publish. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information and every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct. This willful neglect has not only caused much financial hardship, but is a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Moreover, I did not authorize anyone to use my information or to be given to a third party. This is an unauthorized and fraudulent account which was opened without my consent as I never gave permission for this to be opened under my name. I did not agree to any membership, loan or credit card. My personal info had been used to process transactions and open an account under my name without my knowledge. I never gave authority to open such account. It is not authorized and I have never given permission for it to open and charged. Please remove this account from my credit report, all of the inquiries, and block them from placing these unauthorized account on my credit. This is a scam & I was defrauded. This inaccurate account is being reported in my credit records and is hurting my financial stability. I am a victim of fraud and theft. I have requested for verification of this account and send out disputes to the credit bureaus as well. This willful neglect has not only caused much financial hardship, but is a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

I made payments as scheduled on time automatically until I selected to pay off the balance in full which was around {$400.00}. I went into the app and selected the account ending in XXXX I wanted the payment pulled from. The account the payments were coming out of was MoneyLion 's checking account administered by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had my other account linked and all was good in the app but the payment did not come out. I called in and they usually have a 20+ minute hold time minimum, so calling in is gruesome. 
I talked to a rep who assured me they disconnected their account and that it would come out of account ending XXXX and resubmitted balance in full, to which it never came out. Fast forward to XXXX of 2019 I contacted them as payments have not been coming out and they stated that the account is not linked to take them, which I was not sure why. 
I then tried to pay it in full again and they said that their system "" had an error '' and it "" kept trying to take it out of the account that we allegedly unlinked. '' I verified my routing and account numbers for my XXXX XXXX account and the payment was finally taken out for balance in full. 
NOW, fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX they reported me to all three bureaus that I was 30-59 days late on my payments. This may be true on paper but I tried to pay this off THREE times and their system had a "" glitch '' or whatever they called it where the payment would not come out. This caused my credit score to  drop 59 points!!! This is unbelievable. I contacted customer service by emailing "" XXXX '' to only be told to dispute it with the CRA 's. I disagree, what they are doing should be illegal, its their mistake their system had issues, not mine.",,MoneyLion Inc.,MN,55444.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3349910

Failure to do so will create even more severe and detrimental problems for me. I am asking for full reimbursement of {$5000.00} forfeited due to Chases negligence. 

I had issued a blank check ( check # XXXX ) to my soon to be ex-wife, XXXX XXXX. For personal reasons that I rather not discuss at this point, I decided to place a stop payment on this check. 

On XX/XX/2019 I requested a stop payment on check # XXXX. I requested the stop payment in person at the branch located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL, XXXX, I spoke to Officer Relationship Banker MrXXXX XXXX XXXX, who was very helpful and even suggested placing the stop payment on the entire check book. Unfortunately, Mr. XXXX did not process the stop payment correctly. Ms. XXXX somehow learned that I had deposited {$5000.00} in the checking account, and proceeded to write the {$5000.00} on the blank check that I had given her and presented the check for payment. The check was paid to her in contravention of my instructions to the bank pursuant to the stop payment I had requested and paid for. On XX/XX/2019 Mr. XXXX acknowledged the error and processed a Branch Compliant Escalation Form ( attached ) and escalated the matter to a regional escalation department. 

On XX/XX/2019, a representative from the regional escalation department, by the name of "" XXXX '', ( Senior Client Plan Representative ), contacted me and told me that while I had requested and paid for the stop payment, there was nothing JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. can do to make me whole for the  {$5000.00}. She indicated that this was a litigation matter between me and my wife. Additionally, this representative promised that a manager would again contact me to follow up on this matter within 48 hours. I have yet not been contacted by anyone from this department again. 

I am extremely disappointed that regarding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, has acted in such a negligent way and now is simply  dismissing this matter as a legal issue between my wife and I, which is a contradiction with report in the Branch Escalation Form, where the bank employee clearly acknowledged and accepted responsibility for the error. 

I have been a client of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A for over 10 years and have trusted them with my personal finances. This error may be insignificant for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, which is probably one of the largest banks in the U.S., but it is a true catastrophe for me. 

JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA acted in bad faith. Not only did they not apply the stop payment as I requested and paid for, but also they failed to inform of situations in which a stop payment would not be honored, and now they are simply dismissing the matter as if they had not caused the problem. In my humble opinion as a consumer trusting a large corporation, the way this bank handled this situation is a clear example of unfair and deceptive practices. 

I am very concerned with the issue. It is of upmost importance that I get the funds reimbursed as soon as possible. I need these funds to pay my attorney who is defending me in litigation. Not paying these funds will not allow me to formally engage his services. I am currently experiencing a very serious personal and financial crisis. This could result in severe legal and financial consequences to me. I am currently unemployed and I do not have access to any other funds to pay my attorney. Therefore, it is extremely urgent for me to get reimbursed as soon as possible. 

I would like to see what recourse do I have to get full reimbursement of the {$5000.00} as soon as possible. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is able to assist me in this matter.

Finally, CitiMortgage and its attorneys released my loan information to a third party without a written authorization signed by me allowing them to publish and share this information with a third party.

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX  Vs. XXXX  ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX  debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX   sent XXXX  a letter declaring that XXXX  disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX  should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX  proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX  on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX  ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX  loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX  had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX   on this issue. I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

Complaint : This collector ( Assetcare ) added this collection to my credit report without ever making any prior contact. I called them on Monday XX/XX/19 after it just showed up on my credit report ( Saturday - XX/XX/19 ) without my ever knowing it even existed, I was not ever given a phone call or anything in writing. When I did contact this company after the collection just appeared on my credit reports the representative I spoke to told me I would receive a letter by Thursday XX/XX/19 which I didnt receive and I then called them about it again on Friday XX/XX/19 and they finally did send me the letter which I am now sending to you that would show they never made any contact with me and that they would be removing ( deleting ) from my credit reports for this reason. ( It is still on my credit reports at this time ) This company has violated the fair debt collections act ( 809, validations of debt law ) by not contacting me by phone or in writing prior to placing it on my credit reports to give me time to dispute or pay this debt, this law plainly states the collection agency has 5 days after they acquire the debt to make contact with me at which time they must then send a written notice per usps mail to me and then I have 30 days from that point to respond to the letter the collector sends me to either dispute or pay the debt, but since this did not happen they have broken the law. I hope you can help me with this and hopefully it will be removed from my credit reports as I had no idea I owed this or that it was in collections. This collector also stated that they themselves would also be sending each credit bureau a copy of this letter admitting they did not ever contact me prior to placing the collection with the credit bureaus so as to remove the collection from my credit reports. For the record I have been paying all the medical bills I can locate and that I know are mine this one somehow slipped through the cracks, but once I knew about it and was able to contact the original creditor I immediately paid it but my issue with AssetCare is that they never made contact to attempt to collect this bill before they placed it on my credit reports therefore not giving me any chance to check that it was mine or pay the bill if it was mine before they just added it to my credit reports. I can not pay a bill I do not know exist. I have no issues paying something if I owe it and I did pay this bill as soon as I knew about it as I do all my bills I am really upset about this because I try very hard to do things the right way and this company does not do things fairly. I am not the only person they have done this to there are a lot of others complaining about this collection agency doing this exact thing to them and I feel its a tactic they use to get the bill paid then just send this type of letter asking the credit agencies to delete the collection from the persons report when in all fairness they should have contacted the individual as the law allows and given them the chance to respond or pay the debt not just placed it on their credit reports because if a person cares about their credit and a bill collector contacts them 9/10 times it will get paid almost immediately so I just do not see where this was right at all, I had absolutely no idea this existed prior to it showing up on my credit reports. If they had done this the right way and contacted me I would have contacted them contacted the original creditor made sure it was mine and paid this bill which would have stopped it from ever being placed on my credit reports but without any knowledge it existed or that I have a bill out there I may owe, I never got this option. I am in hopes that you can help me rectify this and maybe stop this collector from using this very unethical tactic. This should not have ever happened, it should not have ever been placed against my credit reports before I was given an opportunity to acknowledge it so I feel it needs to be removed immediately.",,"Capio Partners, LLC",FL,33548.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3353258

3145,2019-08-28,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a travel trailer from XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX, Ohio. The loan for the vehicle was arranged through XXXX XXXX Bank and the installment loan terms were set at 11.25 % for 144 months with the first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have cancelled checks, bank statements and receipts that demonstrate that 144 consecutive payments of {$220.00} were made between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. All but one was made within the 10-day due date grace period. Due to prior commitments I was unable to make it to the bank before they closed and I was assessed a {$40.00} late fee the payment was made one day late on XX/XX/XXXX and the late fee was paid. The total amount paid over the 12 years was {$32000.00} ( i.e., 144 payments of {$220.00} for a total of {$32000.00} plus the {$40.00} late fee ). 

Not all payments were made on the due date so I anticipated a final balance of around {$50.00} to account for cumulative miscellaneous interest. However, in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Huntington National Bank which took over the loan from XXXX after their merger a claim was made that I sill had an outstanding principal balance of {$480.00} and that I owed a further {$3.00} in interest on that balance. 

Repeat calls to Huntington have failed to resolve the discrepancy in payment history. Agents and supervisors for the bank have claimed that several payments were deferred or missed. On a few occasions, when the representative provided a date for an allegedly missed payment - and I indicated that I had a cancelled check and receipt that proves a payment was made - they simply stated that is not what the system shows. 

Nobody has been willing or able to provide documentation that a request to defer a payment was made or that shows a payment was missed. A statement provided by XXXX for tax purposes on XX/XX/XXXX indicates that the account was current and all payments made and applied. Please note : 1 ) I never received any notices by mail that suggested the loan was not current ; and 2 ) virtually all payments were made in-person at the local branch and I was never advised of an issue with the loan or the repayment schedule. 

It may also be important to note that the XXXX statement ledger from XXXX does not reflect a standard amortization schedule or simple interest formula - an issue that has persisted since the loan was arranged. The loan calculations fees, payment amount, and totals never matched the signed Promissory Note. As an example : their statement indicates that the first payment was dedicated fully to interest with none applied to the principal. When asked about this, I was advised that the system will catch-up something that apparently never happened. The issues with this loan may have been an isolated mistake but if habitual and applied to additional accounts it could be large scale fraud ( i.e., {$1.00} per installment for a single account is a rounding-error for a large company but if applied to millions of accounts with frequency it would be significant ). 

I have been advised that two cases were opened to reverse the deferral or investigate the misapplied payment but there has been no change in status. In fact, the last representative threatened me with additional late fees, interest and collection activity if I did not pay the balance they indicate in-full within the next 2 days. The agent refused to suspend the due date until the issue has been investigated and a proper balance calculated. 

At this point, it is clear that the customer service agents and supervisors representing Huntington National Bank have no interest in investigating let alone resolving - this issue. Attempts to escalate the problem within the company have failed. Unfortunately, it appears as though formal complaints and the threat of legal action may be required to gain proper attention to this problem. 

See attached : 1 ) list of all payments ; 2 ) the original purchase receipt ; and 3 ) the original promissory note.",,"HUNTINGTON NATIONAL BANK, THE",OH,44024.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-28,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3356914

At the time of the visit, I was XXXX   and receiving XXXX and XXXX for insurance. Additionally, I was going through fleeing from XXXX XXXX. So, I was residing in a confidential shelter. I qualified for XXXX XXXX offered, as well as other XXXX options. I told the personnel about my situation and was given assurance no bill was issued based on information as stated above. As of to date, I am on XXXX and have been since I moved to California XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of any bills until I recently received my credit report. I was surprised to see a balance from XXXX XXXX. I can assure you I was definitely receiving XXXX and XXXX. So, I am perplexed as to why I have an outstanding balance on my credit bureau. 

MESSAGE FROM BUSINESS : Dear Ms. XXXX, This letter is in response to an inquiry received at XXXX XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. The inquiry referenced your complaint regarding your XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) visit on XX/XX/XXXX. Your concern is that the charges for this visit appear on your credit report, and that you were XXXX eligible at the time of service, Treviewed this visit and located the eligibility inquiry our registrar submitted on the XXXX website. Based upon the SS # and birth date provided at registration, it was determined you were not XXXX  eligible on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Please see the attached copy for your reference ). Therefore, this encounter was considered a "" cash '' account because there was no insurance to bill. XXXX-XXXX  eligibility was checked again in XX/XX/XXXX, and again was returned as not eligible. Please note the State of  California only allows one year from the date of service to check for eligibility, so currently we are unable to check for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Treviewed the physician 's dictation from this visit which mentions "" patient is residing in her XXXX ''. Because of this statement in the ED dictation, I will consider this to qualify for our financial assistance program. Therefore, I have contacted the collection agency, CMRE Financial Services, to cancel collection efforts and have this balance removed from the credit bureaus. A letter from CMRE is forthcoming to confirm this information and will be mailed to the address listed above. You can contact CMRE directly at ( XXXX ) XXXX if a letter is not received within 2 weeks. 

Please note we consider this account to be resolved.

3165,2019-10-10,Debt collection,Other debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"XXXX billed me for cancellation of contract and remaining balance due on three cell-phones and they never responded to my dispute as required after they failed to provide service as required. When I signed up with XXXX the person said the Framily Plan contract was month to month, but since the cellphones were set up on a 24 month payment plan if we cancelled earlier than the 24 months the balance due on the phones would become due immediately. That is what I agreed to. 
I have a job that requires I can be contacted 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week by phone. My cell phone was that phone. When my XXXX XXXX XXXX battery died and would not maintain a charge after a short time at XXXX, I went into the local XXXX store XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Ia. After standing there for 1.5 hrs along with other customers while the two clerks waited on the exact same two customers without even acknowledging us, one clerk finally excused himself briefly from the customer and asked what I needed. I told him my battery was dying/dead and I needed a new battery. He quickly informed me that they didnt change XXXX   batteries and that I would have to ship it to XXXX   company itself to have the battery changed. I advised him that my job required a contact phone 24 hrs a day/ 7 days a week since I work on an emergency ambulance service and he rudely advised there was nothing he could do and went back to the original customer. 
I was already upset with XXXX service dropping phone calls all the time in the XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX area when I was calling the hospitals with patient reports. It looks bad when you have to keep calling them back on top of a waste of time that may be required to take care of the patients. It would be bad enough in a rural area, but in a large metro area? 
Since my job requires a contact phone and I got no help from XXXX like maybe an offer of a loaner phone, I immediately went down the road and went back to XXXX XXXX. I got a phone and transferred all three of my contract phones back to XXXX XXXX. 
I paid off all three of the phones at XXXX XXXX which were set up on monthly pymts ) when I received the original ( approx {$1600.00} XXXX bill from XXXX. The pay off on the phones was around $ XXXX {$1200.00}. I am disputing the termination fee since the reason I left was there failure to provide service to fulfill my service contract and as stated above I was told the contract was month to month, that is why I left XXXX and went to XXXX in the first place for the Framily plan. I await a response back from XXXX since they didnt respond to my first written complaint which I sent in with the check to pay off the cell-phones. XXXX cashed the check for the cell-phones, so I know they got the letter. If they chose to pursue the matter I will make sure other customers know what kind of service they provide. 
I submitted this above complaint through XXXX as a complaint a few days ago and the response was that my complaint was accurate, but they did not remove the collection affecting my credit score they only  changed it to unpaid. I want it removed, I am tired of XXXX punishing me for their lack of service.",,"Diversified Consultants, Inc.",IA,52358.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3402456

3187,2019-08-22,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I purchased a vehicle from Drive Now on XX/XX/XXXX. Drive Now is a buy here pay here car dealership. I had previously purchased another vehicle from Drive Now in XXXX and had successfully paid off my loan earlier this year. I am not a new customer to Drive Now. Recently, I had to have significant mechanical repair work performed on the vehicle which caused me a financial hardship since I had to pay a {$300.00} deductible to Drive Now to have my vehicle repaired. Since I knew I needed to request additional time to make my car payment I reached out to Drive Now and requested an extension on my car payment. 
When I called to request the extension to make my car payment I was told by Drive Now employee XXXX that my current loan was not going to be secure unless I called back and made arrangements as quickly as possible. This conversation with XXXX took place on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not want to be in breach of my car loan and was able to setup a secured payment for XX/XX/XXXX in order to make up for the payment I missed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from a man identifying himself as XXXX from an unrecognized phone number. I replied wrong number and I hung up the phone since I normally do not take phone calls from unrecognized numbers due to past incidents with phone scams. I then called Drive Now and asked to speak to XXXX. When she got on the line I was told she was the only one there and had not spoken to me. I requested to speak to her supervisor and transferred me to XXXX. He stated that had called me before but I had hung up on him and explained I usually hang up on callers from unrecognized phone numbers. XXXX then proceeded to say now youre going to verify the last XXXX digits of your social security number in a rude and condescending manner. 
I tried to explain to XXXX my current situation and he interrupted by saying, did you not Bonus this month? I said what are you talking about he said you work for XXXX so you didnt bonus? I then said that I dont bonus at my job and he asked me what my position was and I had told him Quality Analyst. Then he proceeded to ask me do you know XXXX? I was shocked and felt uncomfortable because I do work with another XXXX XXXX   employee named XXXX and then I said to XXXX I am going to discuss other employees with him from XXXX. He then got very upset and said I will give you till Friday to make your payment. 
I am concerned that since he told me he knew a fellow employee, he could violate my confidentiality and privacy by discussing my personal account information. In addition, it was completely inappropriate that he mentioned that he knew one of my coworkers, which made me feel he was intimidating me and/or threatening me and he could embarrass me would by divulging my private account and/or financial difficulties to my co-worker. 
I am now current with all of my car payments with Drive Now. However, I feel I was treated unfairly and unethically by XXXX. In addition, XXXX actions were reckless, threatening and very unprofessional. He has violated my privacy and Im certain it is not one of Drive Nows policies or procedures to threaten or intimidate customers by breaking confidentiality requirements so I am bringing this complaint to your attention.",,"Auto Now Financial Services, Inc., Phoenix, AZ Branch",AZ,85037.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3350987

Its clear they have forgotten the FCRA laws. I have looked over my credit report asking for a investigation concerning accounts on my credit report and deleting the errors and Experian failed to do so. I will be forced to start legal actions if no resolution and I will be contacting Experian CEO XXXX XXXX. Experian does not learn there lesson. Experian has been sued numerous times for failing to investigate. I did not ask for verification, I asked them to investigate and upon there investigation I asked Experian to provide me with this information : "" I am very interested to learn how your investigator ( s ) arrived at this erroneous conclusion. I would like to see a complete list of all documents and correspondence with. Please include all names and contact information of employees that you spoke to at as part of this investigation. 
All previous letters and documents that I sent to you previously are once again attached along with this correspondence in order to help you process this request. '' All I received is a bogus pre-made letter stating information "" The dispute is complete and it meets FCRA requirement ''. I did not get the information I requested. There is comments from the creditor in the comment section of mostly all the accounts that need to be removed for the comment section is for the consumer and I did not authorize Experian to put any comments in the comment section. You also still have XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX all that are in bankruptcy due to Identity theft showing a balance and showing "" charge off '' instead of chapter XXXX, XXXX '' balance with no other comments. 

I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX v XXXX ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the certified letters and dates prepared to bring to court on XX/XX/XXXX. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. 

So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. 

I require a response, on point, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely manner. If I get another pointless letter from you saying that it has already been "" verified '' then there will be no more opportunity for negotiation. This will proceed in court until I have successfully proven to a judge that this false information must be removed from my credit file. I will also be aggressively pursuing the full judgment that I can get against Experian for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Defamation.

3217,2019-03-01,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/, 2019 I had received a notification my credit score had gone down which I am in the process of purchasing a home and can not have it go down, so I logged online to see the reason it had gone down and the notification stated I had one of my credit cards maxed out to be specific my JCPenny Store Credit Card maxed out. I was confused and thought to myself this is clearly fraud because I dont have my JCPenny Credit Card maxed out and the notification continued to say make a payment and bring the balance down to bring your credit score back up. I immediately called JCPenny customer service XXXX at XXXX central standard time on XX/XX/, 2019. I explain to the customer service representative that it shows me maxed out on my credit card and this is wrong and clearly fraud and she stated it was correct that they changed my credit limit to {$280.00}. I asked her on what grounds did they change it and this is deceptive business practices because they did not inform me that they had changed it or why, that I received not notification whatsoever. I told her that as a consumer who agreed to a certain amount when I initially applied for the card a year ago and allowed them to run my credit a year ago and was approved for {$500.00} that this has been my a credit amount this entire time. I told her I have never paid late or gone over my credit limit. The representative said that is correct you were approved for {$500.00} about a year ago and never paid late and said however we have a system that monitors your spending habits and will match your credit line to your spending habits, so I tell the representative okay let me make sense of what you are saying and said since I dont max out my card or use the {$500.00} every month your system is monitoring my spending habits and your system changed my credit limit to match my actual spending amount and she said yes. I tell the representative again this is deceptive business practices to monitor my spending or any consumers spending and based on those grounds they changed my credit limit and thats where I have an issue because it was changed without my knowledge and this hurt my credit score. I told her because you monitored my spending and changed my limit to what I actually spend which is roughly {$280.00} a month and me having a balance of {$270.00} has a negative impact on me and this information reports to credit bureau as a card maxed out and to make a payment to bring balance down and this would then raise your credit score and thats where I have a problem and issue with these deceptive business practices. This company completed deceptive business practices by monitoring my spending but to change my credit limit based on spending habits and not inform the consumer is deceptive and wrong. The representative apologizes and says we can raise it again but to raise a credit limit we have to run your credit report again which I declined and told her why would I run my credit report again to have the same limit I initially started with. I told her I gave you permission to run it a year ago and agreed to a certain amount and for what for you to monitor my spending and just change it. I informed her I was gon na file a complaint because they did not notify me in any way, shape or form and if it was not because of my alert from credit bureaus that there had been a change to credit score I would never have known the amount changed. I told her I could have decided to purchase something for someone as a gift and my card would have been declined and again she apologizes and says lets run your credit score again to raise it back up for you.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426- chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and otherwise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33029.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3553395

XXXX XXXX then re-aged this debt, by reporting to the Credit Reporting Agencies during XX/XX/XXXX, that this debt was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. 
This is beyond the 6 month period between the last payment made and the account being charged off ; Furthermore, according to the original debt holder, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX own reporting shows this account was not written off and closed until XXXX, after the date XXXX XXXX claims the debt began. 

This will cause the debt to remain on my credit report beyond 7 and a half years, possibly longer as XXXX XXXX seems to continue to report updates to the balance and has already increased the original balance of the debt from XXXX as reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX, to XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,PA,17060.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3298544

I contacted Amex customer service and they said the decision was triggered by their system and my account was under review by a team. I requested the credit limit not be reduced because they are hurting my credit standing overall by making this decision immediately after I paid down the balance. The customer service agent assured me that Amex cares which is the furthest thing from the truth.

I believe the way that Amex is managing their accounts is predatory in nature. I would like to see their practices of reducing credit lines audited.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

They took {$15.00} a month from me for years without my knowledge. They took it from my savings that I do not connect with anything else or use for anything.
After noticing something I could not understand at all on my statement listed under my savings ( which I never ever use for anything, thus never checked for anything ), I called Wells Fargo to find out what it was. It was a deduction of {$15.00} a month that I was absolutely unable to decipher what it was for, because it didnt show what it was for. The deduction was a jumble of numbers and letters I could not understand. I immediately called Wells Fargo about this, and ended up talking to numerous people at WF   and explaining and re-explaining the same thing over and over again ( I spent  4  hours on the phone ). I finally reached someone who actually sounded a bit empathetic, who sent me to "" someone who could ( actu ally ) h elp '' me.   They connected me to a man with a thick  XXXX  accent, who did nothing but insult me. He told me I had signed something that allowed them to deduct {$15.00} a month for "" security '' in case my accounts were breached. I know I never ever gave anyone permission to do such a thing. Nothing else was ever listed on that account, except for this mysterious deduction. As I stated, I never checked that account because I never used it for anything but savings.   This man told me I was an   XXXX   ; that it was all my fault for not having checked the account ; that there was absolutely no way WF would ever do anything without my permission ; that I am the stupidest person he had ever spoken with ; that he was sure I had signed something etc ... etc ... etc ... I was in tears and defending myself to a bully. Yes, the man was literally a bully. Over and over again he tried to get me to admit I gave   WF permission to do this, and over and over I told him, Never! I told him to send me a copy of what I had signed so that I could see it. I never received anything in the mail.
This all occurred something like 16-18 months ago.
They stopped deducting the {$15.00}, but I was never reimbursed for all the money they had stolen from me, and I can not find it anywhere on my account. It is like it never happened -- but I have still not been reimbursed for the money they took. A few months ago I spoke to a woman named ""    XXXX  '' at  Wells Fargo,  at (  XXXX  )  XXXX . I explained everything to her, and she sounded compassionate. She said she would "" look into '' my "" situation '' and call me back. She absolutely swore she would call me back within 3 days at the latest. She never called me back, and I have left messages on her voicemail.   I never submitted any complaints to anyone besides  Wells Fargo,  because since they erased all evidence of the months and months of illegal deductions from my savings account without reimbursing me, I have no evidenceexcept for maybe the recorded conversations I had with all the employees I tried to get help fromif they still have these and they are not erased as well.

3284,2018-02-13,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"XXXX XXXX mortgage servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ), has continued to not resolve the dispute that had led to the filing of CFPB complaint numbers XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX against SPS and XXXX and XXXX against prior servicer XXXX with the CFPB. None of the complaints have been resolved. 
Seven complaints have been filed against Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ). They continue to not resolve the dispute I have stated in every complaint. It has come to my attention that they are not informing the mortgage holder, XXXX XXXX, of these disputes, and that XXXX XXXX   does not know that the mortgage may be void and unenforceable according to Hawaii law. If a foreclosure is filed on the property it will go to mediation, but if a foreclosure is filed then it will be filed by the mortgage holder and not by SPS. By not informing XXXX XXXX, SPS has given the mortgage holder a defense in court. That defense will be stated as : we didnt authorize SPS or XXXX to state or say that This means that SPS and XXXX do not have to abide by laws because they have nothing to lose. This action taken by SPS should be illegal and tantamount to fraud. I have repeatedly stated in writing and said verbally, that if the mortgage is proven valid then I will begin making payments again after the agreement between XXXX representatives and myself has been upheld. There is no need to foreclose on my home. Foreclosure is a waste of money since these same issues will be brought up in mediation, which will result in the same conclusion by the court. The court will rule that either the mortgage is void and unenforceable or that XXXX XXXX will have to abide by the agreement made between XXXX representatives and myself and be ordered to add the missed payments to the end of the mortgage, clear my credit record, and order me to resume payments, which I have agreed to do multiple times since this dispute began in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the latest correspondence from SPS they have now accelerated the mortgage and are demanding full payment. They still refuse to honor the agreement between XXXX and myself and though in every complaint I have made to the CFPB and to them directly they have continually failed to resolve the issues. 
I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from Select Portfolio Servicing. The letter stated that I am in default on my loan and listed several options to help me. The second option was Payment Deferral. This has never been offered before by SPS. I have consistently complained and stated to SPS, since SPS took over the account from XXXX that the reason I have stopped making my payments was because XXXX did not honor the agreement that I had with them when the Disaster Relief Program ended. At that time the 6 months of payments that I had missed while on the program were supposed to be added to the end of the loan and I was supposed to resume making my payments in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  representatives called that a Workout. In this letter SPS calls it a Payment Deferral. This has been the subject of seven complaints to the CFPB directed at SPS and two complaints to the CFPB directed at XXXX. These complaints should be made available to the mortgage holder to review so I will not list them here. Now SPS is offering a Payment Deferral, which as I have stated in every complaint, would clear this matter up. However, now they expect me to give them documentation similar to what is required for a modification. I refuse to do this because it was not required when I was on the Disaster Relief Program and should not be required now. I will only abide by the deal between XXXX representatives and myself. SPS and XXXX have been severally, and illegally, hurting my Credit Rating for years because of my protest, now SPS is offering me what was offered to me by XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, which XXXX did not honor. The only one that should be able to report to the credit reporting agencies is the mortgage holder, not the mortgage servicer whom has no responsibility in a foreclosure proceeding. 
I also complained to the CFPB that XXXX purposely dragged out my mortgage Modification in XXXX to XXXX, a charge they have repeatedly denied multiple times and also in both complaints to the CFPB. In a letter from XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, they stated : We found that we may have made an error while we serviced your loan that could have extended the document collection period during our review of your application for mortgage assistance. Weve enclosed a check for {$100.00} as compensation. Then the third paragraph stated : We sincerely apologize for not providing you with the level of service you expected from us. Basically this states that we are sorry for extending the time it took us to modify your mortgage while it continued to add payments to the modification at 8.1 %, which we added to the back end of your loan costing you several hundred thousand dollars more than the home is worth than it would have cost you if we had done our job correctly. So does the CFPB, SPS, or XXXX XXXX think that XXXX did not do their job when they did not honor the agreement that we had on the missed payments being added to the back end of the loan in a Workout during the Disaster Relief Program? As I have stated in every single complaint to the CFPB and directly to XXXX and SPS previously, if the payments that I have missed since XX/XX/XXXX were added to the end of the loan as agreed and my credit report is cleared of 180 day late designations and replaced with NR designations, thereby fixing my credit report, then I will gladly begin making payments again. XXXX and SPS are both guilty and I am not going to be penalized for XXXX and SPS deliberate mistakes or should I say illegal activity. Too much damage has been done to me because of this and neither can fix what they have done to me beginning in XX/XX/XXXX through today, but they can clear this up now. Also, I still dont have any proof that the mortgage is valid according to Hawaii law, which is why I assume that XXXX and SPS are attempting to repair their wrong doing and hide their illegal activities. The mortgage holder should be made aware of all of the complaints, all of the correspondence and all of the verbal communication, which has been recorded between XXXX and SPS and myself. 
In each of SPSs letters responding to my complaints, they do not adequately answer any of the questions that I have asked. They have not provided any evidence that the mortgage broker was licensed in Hawaii at the time I received my mortgage. If the broker was not, then the mortgage is void and unenforceable, a precedent set by a Hawaii Supreme Court decision in XXXX. SPS has provided a statement that the foreclosure has not been converted from a non-judicial foreclosure to a judicial foreclosure as they have claimed previously. They have not investigated my claims of an agreement I had with XXXX prior to SPS taking over the servicing of the mortgage, that are detailed on recordings that XXXX owns. SPS states that XXXX does not have any evidence of the agreement. The agreement is stated on the recordings and without hearing the recordings, which is the evidence XXXX is suppressing, then my complaints will continue until XXXX and SPS comply.

SPS continues to mislead the CFPB by stating that they have tried to reach me by telephone but fail to acknowledge that I have returned their phone calls when they leave messages. I periodically reviewed my caller ID and find recent phone calls from SPS were made but there werent any messages left on my voice mail. This is another deception by SPS to attempt to deceive the CFPB into thinking that I am unreachable and do not return phone calls. If a voice message was left I have always returned the call. I can not see caller ID when I access messages from a remote location. If a voice message was not left I have no knowledge of the call. 
SPS continues to state in their correspondence that they are committed to helping people retain their homes. I have given them every opportunity to honor the XXXX agreement, which is listed in all of my CBPB complaints. Once they honor the agreement I will gladly resume my payments. They also must fix my credit report because I would have resumed my payments as agreed in XX/XX/XXXX if the agreement I had with XXXX was honored at that time. As stated in previous complaints, I am continuing to get punished by negative reports on my credit report because I do not have another option to defend myself in this dispute. As previously stated numerous times over the last few years, I can resume my payments at any time, but XXXX XXXX can still foreclose and SPS will continue to designate 180-day late notices on my credit reports. Also, SPS and XXXX do not have offices in Hawaii so I can not subpoena the recordings. I am confident that if a foreclosure is filed, and the mortgage is not void and unenforceable, that the Judge will order the recordings I have continually requested, delivered to the court. I have made every effort to keep a foreclosure from proceeding but SPSs continuing refusal to demand XXXX turn over the recordings, and their repeated statements that the matter has been resolved has led to these drastic actions. I am sure that XXXX XXXX   has not been informed of any of these complaints by either SPS or XXXX. If they had been then I am sure they would attempt a resolution.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",HI,96778.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2018-02-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2813803

I called twice in XX/XX/XXXX and each person stated that the payment was not going up. At the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement that my payments were going up. I called WEEKLY to try and resolve this issue. The first call in XX/XX/XXXX, I was set up on a payment plan. I was given a confirmation number and told to pay the first installment of the payment plan. I went through the terms and conditions with the woman and accepted. She said it should reflect on my account in 3-4 business days. I gave it 7 days, and my account still stated I owed the full amount. So I called back. This person I spoke to told me that the repayment plan did not get approved and they had tried to call me 3 times but my phone number was disconnected ( it definitely was not, I have had the same number since XX/XX/XXXX ). So we set up a new payment plan, I got a new confirmation number, I went through the terms and condition and they wanted me to pay the first installment. I had just paid an installment the week before, so he refunded the first payment and I paid another payment for this plan. He said it would reflect in 5-7 business days. I gave it 10 business days and my account still showed behind. So I called back. The person on the phone said the processing department was still working on it. I asked when I should call back and check, and he stated "" If you are that worried about it you can call back and check on it, but it is processing the new payment plan ''. 4 days later, it still was not showing and so I called back. This person said that my new payment plan was not approved but they knew a way to make it happen. I got signed up for a new plan, went through the terms and conditions and got another confirmation number. My payment for this plan was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. 7 days later, it was now past my original due date, XX/XX/XXXX, and my payment showed past due. I called back and spoke to another woman who was incredibly rude so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came on and I asked her to explain to me what was going on. She said that one I made that first payment of the new payment plan, it would "" kick start '' and my account would go current. So I asked if I could go ahead and make the payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I made another payment to start my newest payment plan. She said I would get the terms and conditions in 3-4 business days and it would reflect on my account. I kept telling her I did not want this to go on my credit. She assured me it would not. I have checked my account since then, and it had never said current. It always said past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a delinquent letter. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that the new payment plan did not go through, AGAIN. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This woman stated that it was a new type of loan ( even though they have had this loan for 2 years ) and there was no possible way for me to get a repayment plan or new terms. I asked for deferment for 9 months - 1 year, and all she said was are you able to make the payment to catch your loan up? I asked her why no one has tried to call and tell me any of this and why I had been told that I would have a new payment plan so many times and she just kept saying she apologized for the inconvenience. I have been promised 3 different times a new repayment plan. And now there could possibly be a delinquent report on my credit. All I wanted was to defer or lower my payments until my husband could work full time again. I am thoroughly disappointed in the unprofessionalism of this company.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",SC,29621.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3169856

The principal at time was {$180000.00} and was for 23 years at {$1200.00} a month. That mortgage agreement was with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. After the XXXX  refinance, my loan was transferred to CitiMortgage for servicing. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was temporarily unemployed and worked with CitiMortgage to enter into a forbearance agreement in which it was our understanding from our discussions with CitiMortgage that any missed payments and interest would be added onto the back end of our mortgage when payments resumed. The principal at the time of the modification was {$150000.00}, which included all principal and interest and our payments would be {$860.00}. We assumed that the lower payment was a result of our mortgage being into the 17th year of the term. We never asked for or agreed to a new maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX!! I was XXXX years old in XX/XX/XXXX and we would never have agreed to a mortgage commitment until I as XXXX years old ( XX/XX/XXXX!! ). We had other options at the time and certainly would had pursued them at that time had CitiMortgage made full disclosure. I am a XXXX XXXX  and spent most of my professional career in financial services  and could not believe the extent of that CitiMortgage misled us about the impact of deferring payment due dates.

All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq.

Your offices have 5 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 3 days from the date of your receipt as an internal dispute, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

I then made an effort to unfreeze my Equifax account about six months ago, when I was moving. I was able to move, but the freeze was still on my account. I contacted Equifax about the freeze and was told that they would send me documents to unfreeze my account and verify my info. I was told it would take 6-8 weeks for the documents to arrive. They never arrived. I tried to contact Equifax earlier today about the same issue, as I have been trying to adopt the bills for my new residence in my own name, so the property management would not have to pay for my account. I called Equifax and was asked for an incredible amount of information, about my SSN, DoB, former loans, and credit lines. After answering all of these questions, I was told I would have to send a copy of my driver 's license and my SSC to Equifax for verification.

Since the documents they supposedly sent were all lost, I am not inclined to send any sensitive information through the mail, especially when I need to access my account today and begin utilizing it. I asked to speak to managers and supervisors when I was on the phone with Equifax, but I was eventually hung up on, by someone I don't believe I ever talked to. I was on hold to talk to a manager that was two positions higher than the person who I initially talked to on the phone, so I assume the manger there has no real concern for the consumers they are supposed to be serving. I have been trying to get my own credit report unfrozen and usable for the past six months, with Equifax actively working to make sure I am unsuccessful. They knew that if they hung up, I would have to fight through that whole process of giving info again, and most people can't deal with that much stress, especially when working six days a week and taking some time from having a single day off to try and solve this issue.

I need assistance in getting my account unfrozen, because it seems obvious to me that Equifax has no interest in doing so. I've talked to about nine "" different '' people on the phone for them, and I have not had anyone give me any information, or really, any help at all regarding this manner. They all read form a script and try to placate me as if I am ignorant of how things work. I understand how things work, and I understand that if I were to send my information in the mail, I would probably find myself in this situation again after heaving my info stolen. I am not volunteering my information to whomever finds the copies on my driver 's license and SSC. I need my credit account unfrozen, especially when I've literally given them my credit history and have spent over ten hours on the phone with people who seriously do not care at all about the people to which they're responsible.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27705.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3400441

3397,2019-01-14,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"J.P. Morgan Chase bought my mortgage from a mortgage securities pool in XXXX. The mortgage was fraudulent upon issuing. Pursuant to 10 PA Code Section 48.3, the company issuing the mortgage used and provided fraudulent information contained in these sections of the PA code : ( 1 ) A dishonest practice or conduct is characterized by a lack of truth, honesty or trustworthiness, or is deceptive or implies a willful perversion of the truth to deceive, cheat, or defraud. 

Example B : A consumer tells a mortgage originator employed by a mortgage broker that she seeks a fixed-rate mortgage loan without a prepayment penalty that has an interest rate within a certain range. 
The mortgage originator knows that the consumer does not qualify for such a fixed-rate mortgage loan, but does not inform the consumer of that fact. Additionally, in all legally-required disclosures it is indicated that the consumer is getting a fixed-rate loan without a prepayment penalty. However, when the consumer arrives at the loan closing, the mortgage loan that is offered is a variable-rate loan with a prepayment penalty. 

( 2 ) A fraudulent practice or conduct is characterized by deceit or trickery, an intentional perversion of the truth to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right, or an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. Fraud also includes any other definition of fraud under applicable law. 

Example A : A mortgage originator employed by a mortgage broker has promised a certain low-rate mortgage loan to a consumer. However, the consumer does not have the minimum debt-to-income ratio set by the lender preferred by the mortgage originators employer to qualify for the lowest-rate mortgage loan offered. Therefore, the mortgage originator changes the XXXX statement of the consumer to reflect a higher income for the consumer without the consumers knowledge, and then submits the documentation to the lender. 

Example B : An employee of a mortgage lender contacts a real estate appraiser with a request to perform an appraisal and informs the appraiser that the sale price of the property is {$150000.00}. The employee knows that the property will not appraise for that amount, but promises the appraiser future business if the appraiser can make the deal work. The mortgage loan is closed by the mortgage lender based upon the appraisal report showing the value of the property as {$150000.00}. 

In XXXX, I tried to modify my mortgage through HAMP ( now HARP ). J.P. Morgan Chase approved my modification, only to disapprove it 3 months later telling me I am now in default for making partial payments. They also paid my escrow and homeowner 's insurance without my approval or knowledge, only to demand I pay it all back to them since I am not approved for the modification. I managed to hold on somehow. 

I had been paying interest-only for 10 years, and in XXXX I was required to start paying principal and interest.

3403,2019-09-19,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Communication tactics,"Used obscene, profane, or other abusive language","In early XX/XX/2013 Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. contacted me several times, harassing me up to 12 times a day from different spoofed numbers of real people. On one occasion, a female representative advised me that they had filed a suit against me and the only way to stop them from suing me or coming to my job to serve me with a summons was to make a payment with her over the phone. I refused to provide her with my social security number fearing it was a scam but I asked her questions about the debt and to my surprise she was so angry with me that she gave the name of a creditor that I had not done business with in over 10 years. When I explained to her that Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. was breaking the law by filing a suit on that debt and that she disclosed the information regarding a debt without verifying who I was, the young woman simply cursed at me and hung up on me. Immediately after that interaction I wrote to them at their Virginia address and provided very clear instructions to cease and desist contacting me then, and never to contact me in the future regarding any debts purchased by their company. I outlined each of their unlawful business practices and requested that they blacklist my SSN and Name together to prevent any contact from their company on any debt ever, past present or future. About 20-25 days later, all of the mail stopped coming from them, all of the phone calls stopped, and I never received any acknowledgment of my request. Portfolio Recovery simply stopped the harassment. 

Today, I live in constant fear and anxiety from their current onslaught of harassment EVERY SINGLE DAY. They are reporting multiple accounts on my credit reports ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) and I get on average, 6 to 8 BACK TO BACK phone calls from Portfolio. Sometimes they call me using their company phone number but the majority of phone calls they spoof from different area codes/cities/states all over America and I have to trace back to Portfolio Recovery. Their company calls me using every different kind of auto dialer and spoofed phone number they can generate ( using the phone numbers of real people, companies, government agencies, etc ), I have called the phone numbers back and there are real people whose cell phones and business phone numbers are being spoofed by Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. in order to mask the true business calling. Because they are calling me on my work cell phone, I dont always have the option to not answer the phone. Their representatives are horrifically rude, caustic and have reduced me to panic attacks at work. When I try to explain that I dont want to be contacted and tell them that Ive already written them several times and to stop contacting me ; the representatives tell me that they have no record of any one at their company speaking to me and that they dont have any information and cant help me unless I tell them my social security number. It is very clear that they are falsifying contact records because of the way that they violate Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). When they repeatedly call me, they get extremely agitated and demand my social security number ( which I have never provided on an inquiry call ). They have called my work provided mobile phone ( I dont have a personal phone ), day and night and when they dont get anywhere with me they hang up in my face or dial me back to back and leave long voicemails with them eating on the phone. Ive been cursed at, hung up on and then they dial me back to back to back as if it is a sport for them. I have SEVERAL VOICEMAILS from Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. that their phone collection agents leave just to harass me. Most all of the voicemails range 30 to 45 seconds in length and consist of them breathing on the phone, eating on the phone, while I hear very clearly the other people in the background introducing themselves and saying the Portfolio Recovery collection company name to the other people that they are harassing for the day. I live in constant fear of this company and how they aggressively encourage, train and develop their collection agents to yell at and intimidate me. They have made it impossible to for me to live a normal life out of the constant fear and verbal assaults from their call centers. When I returned their monthly attack of postal mail from my home in Virginia with attachments advising them to cease and desist contact on any accounts past, present or any debts that they purchase in the future ; they amped up their phone campaign and then started to contact my family by postal mail. They have begun to send harassing letters to my father ( by the same name but lives over 2000 miles away ), and my parents have returned mail to Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC every single month but continue to get harassing letters even after explaining that Portfolio is going after the wrong person. I wrote Portfolio again about two months ago and I made it very clear in my complaint that they were disclosing my debts to other people and that I was requesting for them cease all communication on any accounts held currently and prohibit future contact on any future accounts. I also explained in that letter that I was filing for bankruptcy and when I have everything put together, that I would have whatever attorney I choose to work with, send them a copy of the filing by mail. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC has made a conscious decision to ignore my REPEATED requests for no contact and violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) by continuing to harass me and disclose the debt to 3rd parties after they have received notices from me on several occasions by mail and by phone. Im requesting escalation of my complaint to the FTC. I am confident that a review by the FTC will show that Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC has been dishonest and continues to break the law. After consulting with a legal advocate attorney who is handling other complaints against Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, I intend to seek all options including any compensation available to me in every instance of violation based on the evidence ( extensive phone records, voicemails, and postal mailings ) I have accrued that documents in full detail their illegal use of telecommunications, continued aggressive harassment, their collection agents verbal abuse and coercion against me, disclosure of the debts to 3rd parties, forceful intimidation, falsification of communication records and failure to abide by repeated cease and desist requests for no contact on any debts owned past, present, or purchased in the future by them.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,VA,23059.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3379112

3434,2019-07-17,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In the process of selling my home, on XX/XX/2019 there was a payoff request made for my loan with Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC by my title company. This mortgage is serviced by XXXX. This payoff statement gives a balance of {$130000.00} which included interest for the entire month of XXXX good through XX/XX/2019. The payoff disclosure sent says they only accept prepayments on the first of the month and my loan allows them to collect interest for the whole month. Closing was on XX/XX/2019 and a check in the amount of {$130000.00} was sent overnight arriving XX/XX/2019. I called customer service on XX/XX/2019 to make sure that the check was received and asked if there was a problem and why it had not been applied. I was told it was received XXXX and everything was fine and that it would be applied later that day. On XX/XX/2019, the check still had not been applied and I called to ask why and was told that the check did not cover the total and it was in the process of being returned. I was told that it was being returned to my address in Ohio that they had on file by certified mail because I had not updated my address to show that I had moved. I spent hours on the phone with several different people trying to get this payment to not be sent to my Ohio address but my current XXXX address, if it had to be returned. I was told that because of the XXXX holiday the next day there was nobody there that could help me. Also, on XX/XX/2019 when I saw that the payment still had not been applied, I made a payment as to not cause any issues with being late on the payment. That payment was posted and the payoff check was now enough and had not been returned but I was told by law that it had to be returned because it did not cover the payoff when they received it. 

The explanation that I was given for the payoff check not being enough was the payoff statement was issued on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX they did a sweep of my escrow account for taxes due on XXXX. This left my escrow account in a negative balance of {$350.00} and funds had to be advanced to that account. I was told that a new payoff statement was sent on XX/XX/2019 and that I should have paid off of that but they could not tell me who that payoff statement was sent too or how it was sent. The first payoff statement was sent to my title company. The new payoff statement as of XX/XX/2019 they sent to my house in Ohio. 

Payoff check was returned to title company received on XX/XX/2019. XX/XX/2019 new payoff was requested by title company {$120000.00} good through XX/XX/2019 and including another month of interest because payment will be treated as if it was received on XX/XX/2019 even though the replacement check was received on XX/XX/2019. 

The long and the short ... 
XX/XX/2019 payoff statement good thru XX/XX/2019 {$130000.00} XX/XX/2019 escrow disbursement made and escrow account ( {$350.00} ) + {$40.00} fees= ( XXXX ) XX/XX/2019 XXXX issued a new payoff statement to reflect the new balance and sends to me the homeowner at my Ohio address which is then forwarded to me in XXXX and received on XX/XX/2019 XX/XX/2019 check for {$130000.00} is received by XXXX. 
XX/XX/2019 I call customer service, they verify they received and payment just has not been applied yet. No problems XX/XX/2019 I make my normal monthly payment of {$1100.00} plus fees XX/XX/2019 My regular monthly payment is applied but payoff is not. I called customer service and I am told it is being returned because the payoff was not enough. 
XX/XX/2019 returned check is received and another is sent overnight for new payoff balance of {$120000.00}.

I applied for a home for my family, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record hurt my ability to qualify due to the low score. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts.

However this bank never change its harassment and threat nature. Instead this bank constantly use false excuse such as charge monthly maintenance fee to steal money from my personal checking account. I have notified this bank at least 5 times in writing asking them to stop interfere the matters which were totally irrelevant with Sun Trust. ( see attachment ). Most recently, from XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/2019 this bank used false excuse such as deduct XXXX  XXXX   monthly maintenance fee to constantly threaten me as a bank 's customer. In the past, I already filed two formal complaints with CFPB accusing Sun Trust bank 's criminal activities. Its behavior and conducts already committed criminal harassment, threat, intervene, interfere, bullying etc. toward me as a victim. Its criminal behavior was exactly like a funeral truck who carried two lines of lights driving toward me at end of 2019. That truck was attempted to access me just like the way Sun Trust deducted money from my checking account in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2019. As I informed Sun Trust, you must pay all my damages {$25000.00} harassment charge for total at least 4 times. Insufficient promotional bonus {$500.00} for the year 2019 when customer like me completed 10 debit purchase and at least {$500.00} direct deposit. Plus under my urgent and extremely serious complaint to CFPB three times to ask return {$20.00} stolen money from my checking account. Until now you have not returned yet after you received my complaint 4  days already except the previous complaint in XXXX and XX/XX/2019. My attitude is very clear and my action is firm, I am NOT going to concede or deduct a penny toward your constant criminal activities. I am being harmed on the monthly basis. And I have great concern about my safety of deposit. As I informed you, the earliest you pay all my claims filed to CFPB as well as the claims filed to mycardbenefits, the earliest I will leave.

XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I.

I called the number and was told my case was denied. When I asked to be sent what was written on my behalf to the petition department so I could ensure my case was properly presented to them, the representative said they couldn't share it with me. When I asked why my case was denied, the rep said I hadn't spent {$3000.00} in 90 days. I stated that the Capital One promotional offer terms were confusing. I asked, Did I need to spend $ XXXX in 90 days, in 3 months, or in 3 billing cycles? I asked, When does the clock start for calculating transaction totals? When I opened the account? When I got the card in the mail? When I activated the card? The rep said that the clock starts the day the account is opened and that I did not spend $ XXXX within 90 days of that date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I told the rep those terms were unclear to me. I asked for the original terms to be shared with me and was told that wasn't possible. I said it's misleading because how can I begin to spend money toward the $ XXXX transactional total if I don't have the card in my possession. I told the rep that Capital One was setting customers up to not reach the $ XXXX mark because the clock starts sooner than customers have the card in their permission and sooner than customers are made aware of. I asked that my case be re-presented to the petition department. I was told this wasnt possible. I asked to speak to the petition department. I was told the department is only capable of outgoing calls. I asked to speak with the reps supervisor. The supervisor said he was the highest possible person to speak with about my issue. He reiterated that I couldnt petition again and that I couldnt be put in touch with the department that made the decision to deny my petition. I reiterated the misleading advertising and terms from Capital One regarding this promotion. The supervisor said there was nothing further that could be done about it. He stated I had spent {$2900.00} in 90 days from the account opening. I stated I had spent {$3000.00} in 90 days from receiving the card in the mail and activating the card the day I received it. I asked him to review and share with me the original terms of the promotion. He said he was unable to do so. I should have received {$300.00} back from Capital One because I spent more than $ XXXX within 90 days of receiving my credit card in the mail.

When I pulled my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed they removed a credit bureau reporting they made on my acct for a 30 day past due notice on my record for XX/XX/XXXX and they changed it to show as 30 days late for XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and asked them why they had changed the date of this late payment reporting and the rep I spoke with seemed very confused and could not give me a clear answer of why this happened. Then, I pulled my credit report again on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed XXXX XXXX had put back the 30 day late reporting on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX XXXX nor Experian ( the credit reporting agency this was reflected on ) ever sent me a notice once this negative item was reinserted back on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Experian about this matter to see why they never sent me a notice once this late payment was put back onto my credit report and the rep with Experian also acted like he was confused and told me he did not know if it was XXXX XXXX or Experian who initiated this removal and reinsertion of the late payment on my credit report. The Experian rep also claimed he could not actually see where the late payment had been removed and then put back onto my credit report. I feel the reason everyone with XXXX XXXX and Experian are acting confused is because no one wants to take responsibility to fix this issue. As a result of the XX/XX/XXXX late payment being removed from my credit report, I want it removed again and this time permanently. 

Another issue I have with XXXX XXXX is that I wrote them two letters disputing the late payments they have reported on my credit report for the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and they just want to keep being stubborn and refuse to remove the negative items or show me proof that my payments were actually late for those months and I requested that they send me proof in my letters to them and they just continue sending me their same generic letter saying they will not remove the items since their records show it is reporting correctly. And their most recent letter does not even address all the months of late payments I disputed with them, but they only mentioned how they corrected the error they made when they showed my account late for XXXX. They say they must report everything accurately according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but yet due to all of the mistakes they have made, that is not what they are doing and I am sure they have probably done this to others as well. 

The reason I am disputing all of the late payments they reported on my credit report is that when I review my payment history on the XXXX XXXX website, it clearly shows my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and this is also what XXXX XXXX told me many times over the phone. And when I review my payment history, I can see where I have been late maybe 10 days or so, but some of the months they reported me as being 30 days late, do not appear to actually be 30 days late based on my payment dates compared with their established due date. For example, I made two payments in XXXX ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), but they reported me as 30 days late for that month and the previous month, I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called a representative with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to have them explain this, they just tell me to file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told them I already did that and they rejected my claim saying the late payments were accurate and since that doesn't make sense to me based on what I see, I am calling them to get an explanation. I spoke with a supervisor with XXXX XXXX who had a very nasty attitude and kept telling me that she is not a credit specialist and that I should just file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told her I don't expect her to be a credit specialist, but I do expect her as a supervisor with this credit card company to explain my payment history and why they may be reporting it as late. 

Then the XXXX XXXX supervisor starts telling me how they go by the billing cycle when determining if payments are late and I told her this is the first time I was hearing this and every other time I called, I was told that my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and that is also what is shows on their website. It just seems they want to justify themselves refusing to make this right. I will upload my supporting documentation to this complaint showing my payment history with XXXX XXXX, my dispute letters to them and their responses. I would also like Experian to be investigated for their part in the way the issue was handled with the late payment for XX/XX/XXXX being removed and then placed back onto my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,78216.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3116117
3625,2019-02-13,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"When I signed up for banking with US Bank in XX/XX/2018, I said 'no ' to overdraft protection. This was presented to me as a blanket option, under which all transactions made against my credit card, debit card, and checking and savings accounts would be denied and I would therefore not be charged a fee. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I made 2 mobile deposits to put money into my checking account in preparation for a credit card payment I wanted to make on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. The balance in my checking account after these deposits was {$4800.00}, and I submitted a credit card bill against that checking account for {$3600.00} on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. I was unaware that the other user on the account also submitted a credit card payment against the checking account for an amount of {$2400.00} on Saturday. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, the bank paid the other user 's credit card bill of {$2400.00} and then overdrafted my payment of {$3600.00}. The bank did not attempt to make the payment against my credit card bill, and yet the amount of {$3600.00} was taken out of my account and then returned on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX, in addition to an overdraft charge of {$36.00}. I called US Bank on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX to address the issue with them and asked why I had received an overdraft fee when I had said 'no ' to overdraft coverage when I created the account. While on the phone with the customer service representative, XXXX/XXXX, I read from the agreement I had signed with the bank, which stated that : "" ... if you have chosen No you will not be charged an Overdraft Paid Fee. '' She responded to me and said : "" Yes, we have customers confused about this and calling to us often ... '' and then proceeded to explain that the charges were allowed under a bait and switch tactic, in which the bank allows you to choose 'No ' when you first sign up, but fails to mention that you must specifically request 'No ' for overdraft protection on certain accounts in order to avoid the charge. The way that this was explained to me was very disheartening. I try my best to understand my finances and make knowledgeable choices about my financial health. I have never missed a credit card payment before and the credit card company dropped their own returned check fee when I called them. Since the bank is trapping many customers in this loophole concerning overdraft fees on certain accounts - even after customers have specified 'no ' - I believe they should refund my {$36.00} and discontinue this malicious and misleading practice. If I had known that my 'no ' didn't cover all of my accounts from overdraft fees, I would have kept saying 'no ' until it did. Before I got off the phone with XXXX/XXXX, I asked her to please extend my 'no ' to any account that hadn't been covered the first time I declined overdraft coverage.

3627,2019-07-02,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"The following account details a series of events that has led to the cessation of my good standing with XXXX and XXXX XXXX as well as a significantly raised premium and subsequent higher monthly mortgage payments. The following details will show that these consequences are of no fault of my own and should therefore be remedied by the party at fault, Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC. 

On XXXX of XXXX, Rushmore Loan Management bought our mortgage loan account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The transfer of service went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX, which coincides with the date of our first payment to Rushmore Loan Management Services LLC. We then made timely payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received notice from Rushmores Insurance Department that we needed to provide insurance information to Rushmore Loan Services. This was a surprise to me as their initial letter ( dated in XXXX of XXXX ) clearly states that the transfer that took place at that time does not affect any term or condition of the mortgage instruments presumably to include the previous ( and presumed current ) insurance arrangement. Upon further investigation, through calling both the servicing department and the insurance department, we found out that we no longer had home owner insurance at all and that we needed to provide proof of insurance immediately or be fined and then given a mandatory company issued insurance that would cost {$380.00} a year with far less coverage as well as additional penalties for the lapse in coverage. However, Rushmore Loan Management was responsible for issuing a check of {$800.00} for our XXXX insurance premium to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and failed to do so, resulting in the lapse of homeowners insurance. After further investigation, it was found that Rushmores Insurance department never received information on our account until XX/XX/XXXX, more than 3 months after they were supposed to have received notice from their servicing department. Timely communication between departments would have indicated that I was a current account with Rushmore Loans but because of their tardiness and miscommunication within the company, the insurance department was unable to issue the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX resulting in the lapse of our homeowners insurance. After multiple phone conversations back and forth with Rushmores servicing department, insurance department, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX company, it was found that our homeowner insurance had lapsed in XX/XX/XXXX and our home was uninsured for the following five months until the insurance department at XXXX got notice of our account and flagged that we were without insurance. Because of this five-month lapse and failed payment in XXXX of XXXX we had to become new customers with our insurance company, losing all previous discounts that we had acquired over our loyal five-year relationship with them prior to this mistake. The result of this is that our premium was raised from {$800.00} a year to {$1700.00} a year. 

I made several phone calls to your servicing department and spoke with various employees and supervisors in an attempt to remedy this mistake. Rushmore Loan accepted responsibility for this mistake and we were told that the difference in premium amounts would be reimbursed to us and any and all penalties applied before then or to follow would be waived and reimbursed as well. It was to my understanding that on XX/XX/XXXX that all had been taken care of and was in a completed status. In XXXX of XXXX I spoke with your servicing department to follow up on the activity on my account and was walked through the numbers on the account and made to believe that it had been remedied but was still in the process of being completed and that a supervisor would contact me to further discuss the transactions. I continued to make payments over the next few months and assumed my account was up to date because I had not received any other letters indicating otherwise and the few phone calls that I made in an attempt to follow up reassured me that everything had been rectified. I received another letter on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that I still needed to provide proof of insurance and when I called to follow up, I was again reassured that it was a mistake, and all had been taken care of and my account was in good standing. Each of these calls were made on a recorded line from your company and with notes from the caller that you can refer to for assistance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into Rushmore Loans to make my monthly payment and found that my regular monthly payment had risen by {$120.00}. When I called to inquire what was going on and why my payment had risen I was told that there was an escrow analysis done on my account and my insurance premium had risen from the year before and therefore my monthly payments rose too. I was on my way out the door to catch a plane out of the country for the next nine days and informed the person I spoke with that I would handle it when I got home because it was apparent that my insurance problem had not been fixed and I was being made to pay for the mistakes of Rushmore Loan Services.",,RUSHMORE LOAN MANAGEMENT SERVICES LLC,TX,75644.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3293569

( Please see page attached from my credit report. ) I was moving and was searching for a new place to live and found XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  on-line. They were advertised as newly renovated and move-in ready. ( This was completely misleading and fraudulent. ) The pictures on-line portrayed a clean and safe complex. I contacted the leasing agent and paid the deposit and fees and rented the apartment. When I arrived at the apartment complex on XX/XX/XXXX they showed me the apartment they said I had agreed to rent. The apartment was inhabitable!! The carpets were filthy ; the bathroom smelled of raw sewage ; the kitchen had never been cleaned, the entry and other common areas were not kept up, there was trash and dog XXXX and XXXX on the stairs leading up to the apartment. I went directly to the front office to complain however they were not responsive and didnt appear to care. I had no choice but to move in. I had no other place to go.

( Please see reviews that have been submitted on line discussing the same issues. ) ( I have attached a copy of my initial correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX. ) After living there for a short period of time, the conditions grew worse and there was no way I could allow myself and my XXXX year old child to continue to live in the condition of the apartment or the unsanitary and unsafe living conditions of the common areas of the apartment complex either, so I moved out.

3652,2019-08-25,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"This is a complaint against XXXX  and the CBE Group. Together these entities have fabricated a debt which was never due, which the actual creditor has agreed in writing was never due, and then, with full knowledge that there was never any debt due, which they intentionally and willfully refused to remove from from my XXXX   credit report. 
As a result, for the first time in complainants XXXX years, he has been denied the extension of credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, explicitly stated the reason for the denial was Credit report shows recent delinquency, public record or bankruptcy. The only alleged delinquency ever in my credit report is the sham prosecuted by CBE Group and retained after notice of falsity by XXXX.

The amount XXXX and CBE Group claim is owned to CBE Groups creditor-assignor ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is small, {$87.00} ; and the identical, false negative report by CBE Group has  been deleted by XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), after they received the same information served on CBE Group and XXXX. 
I am pursuing this complaint, however, because if ever there was an example of unscrupulous dealings this is it. CBE Groups assignor stated in writing months ago that I didnt own it anything ( XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). CBE Group has been asked twice, in writing, to delete the inaccurate report. Instead it then verified the false report to XXXX, weeks after it wrote me stating that it had ceased collection and returned account to the creditor ( ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Worst is what XXXX  has done. It had a straightforward letter from the creditor stating I owed it nothing and another from XXXX/XXXX  showing that the creditor had been paid and that I had never had a financial obligation to this creditor ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I dont know what response XXXX  had from CBE Group. But even if CBE Group falsely reported that the debt was valid and unpaid,  how could anyone accept that claim against the word of the actual creditor and a respected health care insurers statement that I had no debt to the creditor. 
This is NOT a case of a debt that has been paid or settled. There never was a debt. That is the importance of the two year old XXXX document ( XX/XX/XXXX ). It shows that immediately after medical services were provided, XXXX and XXXX paid the health care provider ; that the provider accepted their payments as payment in full ; and that there was XXXX due from me. 
Through ignorance or accident, the health care provider resurrected the claim a year and a half later and sent the unpaid claim straight to its bulldog collection agency, CBE Group. Following its standard practice CBE Group commenced by reporting this as non-payment of a two-year old debt. 
When its creditor received a copy of the XXXX/XXXX   document, it immediately admitted that nothing due from me ( XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). CBE Group, however, doubled-down by reporting the claim as valid while telling me it had dropped the claim. 
XXXX had to choose between two irrefutable written statements that the claimed debt was false or the unsubstantiated verification of a collection agency with perhaps the most consumer complaints on file with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 
XXXX  sided with CBE Group : The information you disputed has been verified as accurate. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Almost worst, XXXX   updated the delinquency. To give its validation the appearance of an in-depth review, it corrected the amount and raised it from {$87.00} to {$88.00}. XXXX did not even include my information to reflect that it was a disputed claim. Instead, I had to commence an entirely new process and maybe it would put my position along side that of a shyster. 
If this is how the system works then the entire system is a fraud. Both XXXX and CBE Group should be held accountable.",,"The CBE Group, Inc.",WY,83002.0,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3352549

3663,2019-02-10,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"Here is an attatchmemt of the documents i sent to Equifax : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Equifax Dispute Department Disputing Items On Credit Report Equifax XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Equifax Dispute Department : I am writing to dispute the following information in my file : Item 1 : XXXX XXXX, Closed/ Charge Off Account, Account Number identified on Report XXXX XXXX You will also find this item circled on the attached credit report. 
The item I have identified isinaccurate for several reasons. To start, it is a charge off account with monthly payments listed, which would then make the account installments. An account can not be charged off and closed with monthly installments. In addition to, the account is listed in the closed section of my credit report, however there is no closed date reflected on the report as required. It states the account was charged off in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX however, when stated on my credit report, Charge Off Amount, this section is also blank on my credit report. This will be highlighted on the attached credit report for your observation. XXXX XXXX also claims to have mailed me a copy of the Explanation of Calculation of Surplus or Deficiency on XX/XX/XXXX. This letter states that the amount of deficiency as of that date was {$11000.00}. I spoke with 2 representatives who emailed me a copy of this report claiming to be directly associated with XXXX XXXX. The company goes by the name XXXX. I will be attaching screenshots of the time stamped emails with the attached Explanation of Calculation of Surplus or Deficiency Letter. Both representatives also claim that this statement reflects the current balance owed on the account is {$11000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX of the representatives is XXXX XXXX. Her information can be found in the timestamped email attached to this letter. As highlighted on the Credit report, the balance reads {$9300.00} last reported XX/XX/XXXX. I spije with another gentleman from XXXX whom stated the amount owed was {$9300.00} currently. He then stated the account was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. The company has knowingly reported information contradicting their report of the remaining balance, since XX/XX/XXXX. Seeing that these balances dont add up and the furnishers have been knowledgably reporting information contrary to their documentation, I request Equifax remove this account from my credit report. If XXXX or XXXX XXXX counters this request, I ask that Equifax request an itemized account of all financial records starting with the original opening of the account in XX/XX/XXXX. They Should account for the balance reported on my credit report of {$9300.00} and also account for the balance of {$11000.00} as reported by XXXX XXXX and the Explanation of Calculation of Surplus or Deficiency Letter. They should explain the significant difference in these figures and prove which one to be accurate. They should then send in an explanation as to why they reported false information on my credit report for the past 2 years or why they have emailed and mailed me false information regarding the balance of this account. All documentation received by Equifax from XXXX XXXX XXXX should be forwarded to my address listed above. 
I have attached all necessary supporting documentation to support my claim. 
I am asking you to reexamine this item and remove it from my file at your earliest convenience. I sent this letter via fax to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as certified mail to ensure this matter is resolved within the required 30-day window. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX Either way i have given the furnisher more than 3 chances to correct my credit report and it has yet to be done. This is a clear violation of FCRA and should be removed from my credit report via the furnisher, however they refuse. I have voice recordings of all my encounters with the company. Please help me. My qife is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and this issue has delayed our house buying capabilities for ther past 2 years.

3719,2019-07-27,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I was XXXX years old when I lost my job in XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for unemployment in DC in XX/XX/XXXX and received unemployment benefits until XX/XX/XXXX when my benefits were exhausted. I currently live in a town home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX and have a mortgage thru Dovenmuehle ( loan XXXX ). It is a 15 year fixed that was initiated in XX/XX/XXXX and matures in XX/XX/XXXX. My property value is about {$460000.00}, and the outstanding balance on my loan is {$170000.00}. My monthly payment is {$2200.00}, which is a 15 year fixed at 2.875 %, of which over {$1400.00} is principle ( see attachment ). 

Because I am unemployed ( and may remain unemployed for some time ), I have little to no money coming in. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sought assistance thru Dovenmuehle 's Loss Mitigation Department and requested a loan modification where my loan could be streamed so that I do not have to pay so much principal every month at a time I am not receiving much money ( see attachement ). 

My case was assigned to a XXXX XXXX at Dovenmuehle. However, instead of receiving a loan modification, I received in late XXXX via an overnight urgent delivery XXXX package from Dovenmuehle dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment ) asking me to sign on an urgent basis ( i.e. Due XX/XX/XXXX) a 3 month forbearance agreement where I would not have to pay any mortgage payments for 3 months. This was the only Option Dovenmuehle presented me, as I was not offered any loan modification option. I immediately called Dovenmuehle, and I told them i ) this is not what I wanted or needed, ii ) that this was bad for me as I would be subjected to a balloon payment at the end of the 3 month forbearance  period to make my loan current at a time I was not earning money. I was told by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at Dovenmuehle as well as XXXX at XX/XX/XXXX that they could not offer me a loan modification at this point because I failed the Imminent Default Test, but if I accepted the forbearance agreement, I would later be eligible for a loan modification as per XX/XX/XXXX rules. They explained that Forbearance would allow me to go into default without incurring any fees and penalties, so that I could later pass the Imminent Default Test and therefore later be able to recieve a loan modification. I was encouraged to accept the forbearance agreement ( Dovenmuehle 's only Option offered ) and then apply for one or more renewals of forbearance in additional 3 month blocks, after which I should then apply for a loan modification. They indicated that I would have to undergo a minimum of 6 months of forbearance, but could undergo 12 months maximum of forbearance by such renewals.

They also characterized my situation as "" temporary '', which I took umbrage to as I felt that my unemployment is likely to be longer term.

Being suspicious of all of this, I called HUD. HUD urged me not to sign the forbearance argeement because in addition to damaging my my credit and FICO score, forbearance may not lead to a loan modification. In other words, HUD explained to me that even if I went thru 6 or 12 months on forbearance, Dovenmuehle could still refuse to offer me a loan modification if I at that time I do not have a sufficient income stream ( this again goes to Dovenmuehle characterizing my situation as  temporary when it is likely to be longer term ). HUD also explained to me that Dovenmuehle could offer me a loan modification at any time, but it was not in their interest to do so as it incurred time, fuss and expense on their part.

At this point, I realized that I was esentially being set up for a trap whereby I would be lured into signing the forbearance agreement under the belief that a loan modification would follow, but after accruing 6 to 12 months of missed payments in forbearance, I would be forced to make a balloon payment of {$30000.00} to make the loan current after 12 months of forbearance because Dovenmuehle is likely to deny me a loan modification because I still did not have a sufficient income stream to modify my loan. In other words, I realized that I would be severely damaged by their forbearance offer. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX ( initials XXXX ) at Dovenmuehle. I again explained the situation to her, and she urged me to file an appeal. Consequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I appealed the XX/XX/XXXX decision ( see attached ), and this appeal was denied on XX/XX/XXXX ( see decision attached ). 

Since then, I complained to XXXX  and XXXX, and since that, I received a lot of unusual behavior from Dovenmuehle, such as their Collections department calling me on XX/XX/XXXX saying I missed my XX/XX/XXXX payment when in fact I had paid them electronically on XX/XX/XXXX, etc.",,"Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc.",VA,22315.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3320638

( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

3770,2019-04-16,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I fell behind on my payments when my hours were cut at work. I knew I could catch up again after my tax return arrived. I received one phone call a month from the mortgage company that left a message. The person whispered the message that was not able to be understood. I did not know who to return a call to. I tried the loss mitigation process once before and it piled up endless fees and led to harassing phone calls and being yelled at, insulted, intimidation tactics, and peculiar questioning. No one was able to tell me what those late fees were at that time either. I could not log in to my account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a certified letter stating that for reinstatement to pay XXXX. That same day I went to the bank, purchased a bank check for the exact amount, went to the post office and sent it priority mail to arrive XX/XX/XXXX. OnXX/XX/XXXX a person from XXXX  XXXX phoned me and I told her I sent the amount in the letter XX/XX/XXXX. She then stated an amount very different from what was in the letter the day before. I told her that I sent the exact amount that was stated in the letter. She told me it brought me to XX/XX/XXXX payment due and asked me when I would be able to pay this. I told her I would pay it before the end of the month and the late fees. She said that would be fine since my account had not been assigned to an attorney. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter and a paper for an Automated Property service on my property. They are charging me {$14.00} for this.

On XX/XX/ I received another one of their letters stating they received my funds but because they have accelerated my loan and the payment was insufficient to pay what is owned on the loan or reinstate the loan, they are continuing with the foreclosure. Nothing has ever given me a date or time frame and what is lacking in fees is never stated. I then went to see if I could access my account, this time it let me in so I could see if I can find out what these fees were. I was then going to go in on XX/XX/XXXX to pay them. When I got off the phone with a CFPB  representative to do so, XXXX XXXX has taken away my ability to pay it online since last night ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I also sent them an email that has not been given a response other than locking me out of my ability to make a payment. At this time I found the fees that I owe that are {$120.00}. It shows Late charge assessment- {$95.00} and Property Inspection Fee- {$28.00}. However, as I said earlier, they have locked me out of my account as of today XX/XX/XXXX so I can not pay this fee or my mortgage for XX/XX/XXXX Of {$930.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the same letter as on XX/XX/XXXX by certified mail. 
They are intending to foreclose on my property for the fees they refused to share with me in the amount of {$120.00}. I sent them the email to see if they would tell me what it was, but I did my own digging around to find them myself. I know this is not legal for them to withhold information and threaten a foreclosure. Then after I go in to find the information they lock me out of my account so I can not make a payment. I do not understand how they can withhold this information and do a foreclosure for such a small amount. I just have my current months mortgage payment to pay and their hidden fees.

Both XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX I have made serval attempts over the past 12 months trying to resolve this issue with XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX. I sent in my dispute in XX/XX/XXXX and received 2 response on XX/XX/XXXX on report # XXXX. On the first letter said the bankruptcy was deleted. I thought this has finally got corrected. Then 2 days later I received another letter from XXXX  saying it was verified as accurate. The Report date was XX/XX/XXXX and report # XXXX. I have attached these 2 documents. Transunion sent back a letter saying Verified as accurate and XXXX. The other issue is when they sent the second letter saying verified as accurate they indicated is was verified by XXXX a Third Party Vendor. Transunion Stated the Bankruptcy was verified by the Bankruptcy Court in XXXX, TX. FCRA states you must verify with the original furnisher to get accurate information. This would be the Bankruptcy court in XXXX, TX where my credit report stated it was filed. This Bankruptcy was placed on my credit report in error. I sent a letter to the Bankruptcy Court and I do have that letter that will be attached also. The Bankruptcy Court sent me a letter saying they do not report information to or remove information from the credit Bureaus. 

The Bankruptcy is the original furnisher. XX/XX/XXXX I send another letter asking for a Method of Verification that is my right to know how XXXX verified the information they claim is accurate. This is stated in FCRA. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter stating verified as accurate. I sent out another letter in XX/XX/XXXX asking again the method of verification and on XX/XX/XXXX again they say verified as accurate. Nothing saying how they verified this bankruptcy. Just violation after violation. This bankruptcy has an address that is not mine and not on my credit report.

3811,2019-11-19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"After many attempts to correct items on my credit on line, by phone and fax, I am filing this complaint because Trans Union stated my last complaint to the CFPB was a "" duplicate '' which it was not. On XX/XX/2019 I faxed XXXX XXXX of Trans Union them the attached letter. On XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a response, with a form letter on "" How to read your Investigation Results and an updated credit report, which still did not have the necessary corrections, or remove outdated accounts. 
Trans Union HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY REPEATED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, as stated in my letter faxed to them XX/XX/XXXX. It is well over 30 days & in less than a week will be over 60 days, this is unacceptable. 

I continue to get updates that either state the information is accurate, ( when it is not, ) or that information that is "" Accurate '' remains on your report an average of 10 years from the day it is closed. 
I went to the Trans Union site and read the "" Frequently asked credit questions concerning "" How long does Negative information stay on my credit report? '' It stated 7 years or 10 years for positive information, adding revolving accounts, such as credit cards with a positive history will stay on your report for as long as the account is active, which is a contradiction of their prior statement, along with the fact that, Trans Union is ignoring both Federal & State Laws ( California, ) for credit. 
Additionally, I have repeatedly explained that not only is my credit report based on the FCRA, but also on the California bill of Rights, which gives me the right to request information that is older than 7 years whether negative or accurate to be removed from my credit file. 
There are creditors reporting 15+ years since the file was closed or became inactive, that the bureaus refuse to remove. When a company such as XXXX XXXX is transferred the Servicing Rights of my loan from XXXX  XXXX XXXX, they may not report for 60 days after the transfer, yet they did. 
When an Error Notice is in progress the company also can't report on my credit, but Trans Union accepted their information. Additionally, after the credit bureau deletes/corrects Mortgage information on my report, the new Servicer can not add it back in, but Trans Union allowed this inaccurate information to reappear. Furthermore, my report states ; XXXX  XXXX XXXX inquired on my credit XX/XX/2019. Even though there permissionable rights to check my check extinguished on XX/XX/2019, when the loan was transferred, and sold to XXXX XXXX. 
I made a request in writing for corrections : Investigation Request to Delete inaccurate credit reporting, unrecognized accounts, & outdated ( over 7 years. ) based on the most recent credit report & in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681I ), and the State of California - Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act, CCRA 1785-1788 the California Bill of Rights, or California Code of Civil Procedures : Section 1021.5 I am practicing my right to challenge questionable information that I have found on my personal credit report made on my personal credit report. I am now requesting a re-investigation under Civil Code - Title 1.6 -1785.30, by making this written demand to correct all items disputed within the next 30 days. I am also requiring Trans Union to correct or delete all items found to be inaccurate during the dispute period. If you have not been provided with any evidence the information originally provided is correct, your agency shall delete the information from my report. If the reported information is not corrected, modified, or deleted, I ask that I am promptly notified and provided with all relevant information that is received by the Agency concerning my dispute. What is most important is correcting the information reported by XXXX, as I am trying to purchase a home, and their inaccurate reporting has dropped my overall credit scores over 100 points. in the status section for XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  it should state : Original Creditor was : XXXX  XXXX XXXX Company Sold on : XX/XX/2019 Balance as of this date : {$290000.00} Monthly Payment beginning XX/XX/19 : {$970.00} Terms : 32.42 yrs./389 months ( See XXXX  XXXX  XXXX amortization agreement . ) Missing payments made on : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$1300.00} The last payment made XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00} & isn't documented. This is important to report because this loan changed both lenders & Servicer 's with the first payment to the new lender on XX/XX/19 not shown nor XX/XX/19. 
Under RESPA there is a 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any federally related mortgage loan, a late fee may not be imposed on the borrower. This is often misinterpreted as meaning that after 60 days the new mortgage loan servicer MUST report the account to the credit bureaus, this is incorrect. The 60-day rule simply says that credit reporting can not occur if a payment has been made, not that credit reporting is required. XXXX   XXXX XXXX accurately shows a balance of {$290000.00} Monthly Payment beginning XX/XX/19 : {$970.00} Terms : 32.42 yrs. or 389 months ( See XXXX  XXXX XXXX amortization agreement. ) Some of the information was correctly deleted in the report as requested, while other information was disregarded because the creditor stated it was accurate. 
The accounts below are reporting incorrectly please investigate these : 1.  XXXX XXXX XXXX account # XXXX closed over 7 years ago/ Auto Loan 2.  XXXX XXXX XXXX account # XXXX closed over 7 years ago/ Auto Loan 3. XXXX XXXX XXXX account # XXXX closed over 7 years ago/ Auto Loan 4.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,34142.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3554390

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies.

Everything was accurately planned and scheduled and sent to me. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I traveled without any problem, picked the car, checked in at the hotel with no problem at all. 
It is the norm that I authorize the incidental costs on my credit card, I never had a problem. 

Everything went so well, I returned the car, with the gas tank half-full and I did return it on time as it was sent to me in the plan I had in hand. 

Thu, XX/XX/2018, I was hit by a charge on the car rental, I called and emailed customer service of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' to investigate about that charge, and I was nice enough to say if you want to charge me about the half tank gas, it is OK, you can charge me for the full tank as per the price agreed upon and return the rest of the money. 
I requested a bill, they actually did send me a bill of {$130.00} that includes the whole thing with the rental ( that was paid for already ) with the gas with everything, I called my bank ( Capital One ) to dispute and a nice lady interfered and I stayed over an hour on the phone, 1- If my total bill is {$130.00} only why am I charged with {$170.00}? 
2- I claim that I owe them only half a tank which is according to the prices is {$38.00}. 

They offered to give 50 % discount, convincing us to get 50 % of the {$170.00}, which I hatefully agreed on and I was refunded {$19.00}. 
I rejected that refund while I was still over the phone with my bank and the merchant. 
I tried so hard to have answers for the above 2 questions. I never succeeded. 
The banker agreed to give me 100 % refund and asked me to submit all the documents I have that prove my trip was fully booked. 
I did provide all the documents I had which show clearly my point. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I found that I was re-billed the amount .. 
I called again, my bank, the banker confirmed they received all my documents and he was confused, struggling with words and told me that I had to talk to his manager.

The manager, she can not do anything about it and I will have to go to the Merchant to bring a signed bill because they do not know how much to charge me.

She wanted to convince me that {$170.00} is the price of the gas and that {$19.00} is half of the price of the gas. She did not make any sense, I have all the phone records ( as they do ) and all the documentations as well..

3891,2020-08-21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"The Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681, is U.S. Federal Government legislation enacted to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. It was intended to protect consumers from the willful and/or negligent inclusion of inaccurate information in their credit reports. To that end, the FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Together with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the FCRA forms the foundation of consumer rights law in the United States. It was originally passed in XXXX, and is enforced by the US Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and private litigants. 

This complaint is to advise that Equifax has failed to honor our rights under the FCRA act which gives  us the right to obtain a FULL, COMPLETE, PRINTED copy of our credit reports upon request! The option to dispute, delete, suppress and opt out of inaccurate consumer reporting. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter and I submitted an online request at XXXX to receive copies of our credit reports! We were denied access because we failed to answer security questions correctly due to the information not belonging to us. Her report was asking questions about me and my report was asking questions about her. We were also being asked questions that we thought didn't apply to us because neither of us have accounts associated with some of the security questions asked. That same day, we called Equifax and spoke to someone over the phone and requested to receive copies of our credit reports to be mailed to us! The agent was not from the United States so there was a language barrier issue. The agent continued to ask us NONE specific questions like, do you have a car loan, student loan or mortgage that was obtained within the last 2 years and if so, what is the name of the provider, original loan amount and monthly payment due. Every time we gave him our student loan information he would ask if we had anything else. Any other loans. We continued to name each student loan listed on our XXXX XXXX accounts because we didn't have physical copies of the reports and needed them to see the accuracy of everything. We continued to fail verification even though we provided information exactly as presented on the XXXX XXXX app. The agent was confused about how to pronounce the words, when we asked him to spell things, he got mad and eventually hung up on us. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we tried calling Equifax again requesting copies of our credit reports. We received another NONE United States agent. This time the questions made a little more since but the agent still was confused about the difference of HAD and HAVE. We asked him if he was saying H.A.D as in old and closed or H.A.V.E as in current and opened. He said either one would be fine. So we gave him our CURRENT account information and failed verification again! We requested a supervisor and he hung up on us instead! 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called Equifax to request a copy of our credit reports and spoke to another NONE US Citizen. She was very polite at first and then got upset when we asked her speak a little slower so that we can understand what she was saying. She said that she had other calls that she needed to take and didn't have time to keep talking to us. We asked for her supervisor and she said that there wasn't an available supervisor but she could take our number and have one call us back. We told her that we didn't have a phone so we'd like to just continue waiting on hold. She hung up on us. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we called Equifax and spoke to an agent that was able to assist us properly. He was understanding of our concerns and promised that we'd receive our credit reports within the next 7-10 business days. We never received a copy of the reports. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter and I called CFPB and submitted a complaint # XXXX against Equifax and it read as follows : "" My complaint is that the credit report is adding us as aliases of one another so my information is on my daughter credit report and her information is on my credit report. We have send in documentation several time to proof that we are not the same individual, they have refuse to separate us. Even though we have different last name, different social security and different date of birth. They have refuse to send us both copies of our most resent credit report. We requested they put a freeze on both of our credit report and they haven't done so. They have fails to verify the accuracy of the information that they are adding to both of our credit report. This causing us both to be denied credit, apartments and other assistance the information that we giving them is not matching with the information that is been reported to our credit report. We have requested the they separate us and they haven't done so. '' The CFPB agent didn't include exactly what we advised her to say but, it was close enough! So we just waited for a response from Equifax. On XX/XX/XXXX, Equifax responded to the CFPB that they needed more time, they were still working on the complaint, that they would do an investigation and send us copies of our credit reports after the investigation was done. On XX/XX/XXXX, 35 days later, the company closed out the complaint stating that they needed more information from us. Therefore, refusing to send us copies of our credit reports and no information regarding the investigation. So basically, they just stalled out the process only to deny us access to our credit reports again! 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed another complaint # XXXX with CFPB because Equifax kept reporting incorrect information. The complaint read as follows : "" Company reported the incorrect balances in XXXX, XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. Investigation didnt resolve the problem. Only made it worse. My credit score decreased by 79 points because the company reported balances that were not equivalent to the actual statement balances. Theyre reporting balances AFTER the statement closes which are higher. I was denied credit and denied credit line increases because my utilization has been at 58 % or higher because of their errors instead of being at the recommended 30 % or less. '' Equifax responded on XX/XX/XXXX stating that they'd completed the investigation and send us the results after the credit card companies respond to them. We have received no results, no credit reports, no information from the credit bureau at all. Another refusal to give us access to our reports! 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I registered and paid for the 3-in-1 report and scores from XXXX  because I was not successful with Equifax directly. I reviewed the report and called Equifax to request deletion of all incorrect personal information. I asked that ALL misspelled names, addresses, phone numbers, employers, fraud alert and inquiries are removed, deleted and suppressed effective immediately. I also requested to be permanently removed and opted out of all soliciting, marketing, promotional offers and information sharing or selling. I advised the agent that I did not want anyone to be able to access my credit report without my permission. We added a security freeze! I was not provided with a pin number nor was I able to create my own. I also requested to receive a NEW, FULL, COMPLETED, PRINTED copy of my report AND a separate copy of the investigation. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have received nothing. No credit report or investigation results. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I printed, mailed and faxed a dispute letter to Equifax regarding incorrect information being reported on my credit report. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received a response, no investigation results, no new credit report. ( Letter Attached ) On XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter and I called Equifax again! Requested the same information above less the security freeze! We requested a FULL, COMPLETE, PRINTED copy of our credit reports and to be opted out of soliciting, information sharing, marketing and for our files to be suppressed. This company is fraudulently reporting incorrect information for my daughter and I. They are fraudulently reporting that we are the same person. They are illegally reporting that we are aliases of one another. We do have the same first name only and different last names. She's my daughter so we have resided at the same addresses and we've been authorized on each other 's credit cards, etc BUT we have different date of birth 's and different social security numbers. This company has failed to verify any type of facts before sharing personal information and details. Because the names are similar, they never take the time to confirm and verify if it is the same person or not. They have caused my daughter and I to be declined credit, declined rental assistance, rejected applications and higher interest rates and security deposits. They have never verified if we are the same person or not even though our information is completely different. Both of our information is listed on each other 's credit reports, public records, background checks, employment history, 3 major credit reporting agencies, insurance reports, etc ... We are requesting that this company completely remove all incorrect information listed in the attached letters effective immediately! We are requesting that the company sends each of us SEPARATE copies of our credit reports and files for us to each review. We are requesting that a security freeze is added to both of our files so that no further misleading, misinformation, incorrect, fraudulent information is reported again. We are requesting that they refund us for the extra time and money that we had to pay out of pocket to dispute, repair and correct our profiles only for them to submit the incorrect information illegally again. We are requesting a refund of the extra interest rates that we were charged because our scores decreased due to incorrect reporting. We are requesting that this information is completed expeditiously and that it is not delayed or held up any further. This company stated that they have no control over what other company 's submit to them or have no control over what my score is or what my report reflects. This company continues to report the wrong name, spelling of my name, wrong last name, wrong addresses, wrong phone numbers and wrong credit information. This company has failed to send us a physical paper copy of our credit reports. I have called them consistently requesting a paper copy of my report. WE WANT A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE REPORT! WE DO NOT HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER, PRINTER, COPIER OR FAX MACHINE! SEND A PAPER STATEMENT OF THE ACTUAL REPORT! They have also failed to remove any incorrect information for me including personal information, credit inquires and credit accounts. WE NEED AN EXPEDITED, CURRENT COPY OF OUR CREDIT REPORT TO BE SENT TO US VIA OVERNIGHT SHIPPING EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY! '' They ask for our names, addresses, social security numbers and if we want to add a phone number to the profile. Each time, we tell them that we DO NOT WANT TO ADD A PHONE NUMBER TO THE PROFILE! We need a FULL, COMPLETE, PRINTED COPY TO BE MAILED US so that we can see what's actually in the report BEFORE we dispute it! OUR FULL NAME, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, PHONE NUMBER, CREDIT ACCOUNT INFORMATION, ADDRESSES and EMPLOYERS need to ne CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY! WE NEED TO BE SEPARATED EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY! 

Equifax wants us to verify INCORRECT, INVALID INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE LISTED IN THE CREDIT REPORTS! IT IS WRONG! IT IS NOT US! FIX IT! 

We don't get to choose what is or isn't reported. This explains why I was a victim of identity theft! They volunteer personal, sensitive, private information to individuals. They sell, market and share your information with anyone! I am requesting that the CFPB assists me with filing a lawsuit against this company effective immediately because my information has been listed on the dark web, emails and phone numbers have been comprised and cloned. I have been a victim of identity theft and could not figure out until now how individuals were able to obtain my information so easily. I have had to pay credit monitoring services, been denied credit, credit scores are at an all time low and I am consistently fighting with the credit bureaus regarding accounts, inquiries and information that doesn't belong me. This letter is to inform, request and advise Equifax that the personal information and accounts being reported by your company on our credit reports are inaccurate, incorrect and do not belong to either my daughter or myself and that I am officially notifying you that I am disputing the information and demanding that it is all deleted, removed and suppressed effective immediately! I recently disputed these accounts and personal information with the credit reporting bureaus that you are currently reporting to and the information was reported as verified and accurate. Im sure we both understand that most disputes are often conducted using software such as e-Oscar and that mistakes can and often are made during that process, it is a known fact that the software can have limitations when it comes to completing a proper investigation of records. We are disputing the information directly with you, the furnisher of information and I am requesting that you conduct an investigation as outlined in the FCRA Section 623 : If youre unable to perform a reasonable investigation and are unable to locate the necessary documents to investigate my disputes, then you are required by the FCRA to remove the negative information from our credit reports which can also include complete removal of the account. If you were able to conduct a proper investigation of the records for these accounts and have identified the information that was being incorrectly reported, you were supposed to furnish me with the proof immediately. But since you failed to supply us or furnish the reports immediately upon our requests and delayed sending us the information, you didn't abide by the FCRA law! We are also requesting that you send us an explanation of the methods used and a description of the records reviewed when you conducted your investigation ; including sending copies of that information to us so that we can conduct our own investigation into the accuracy of your records and verify that a reasonable investigation was completed. This letter was submitted to you via CFPB website complaint portal. If need be, the items will also be faxed, emailed and sent via US Mail. This letter is an attempt to correct the false or misleading information you are reporting on our consumer credit reports and to correct your records NOW! ALL INCORRECT INFORMATION REMOVED! ALL INCORRECT INFORMATION SUPPRESSED! WE NEED TO BE OPTED OUT OF YOUR MARKETING TACTICS! DO NOT SHARE, SOLICIT OR SELL OUR INFORMATION TO ANYONE ELSE!

3922,2018-01-09,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"This complaint involves TD Bank. I sustained damage from Hurricane Irma. I received the attached check from XXXX the only insurance company in Florida pretty much. After three months, I received a miniscule payment from XXXX. The check was made out to me as payee and XXXX XXXX XXXX and to the lawyer who is handling the insurance claim for me without whom I wouldnt get anything. 
The check was endorsed by XXXX XXXX XXXX with a signature guarantee. The check was endorsed by the lawyer. I went to the XXXX branch of TD Bank on Friday XXXX XXXX, 2017 where I am known to deposit the check. I made the mistake of consulting with the assistant manager XXXX XXXX. She insisted that the lawyer fax her a signature guarantee notarized on the lawyers letterhead. It took me two days to get all the appropriate signatures including going through just about every department at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The assistant manager would not allow me to deposit the check into my own bank account. I was not attempting to cash it, commit fraud, or do anything illegal with the check except for deposit it into my account. I asked the assistant manager why she was not accepting the check. She claimed TD bank does not accept insurance checks. I asked her if she could provide me with the policy or regulation regarding insurance check. Attached is what she gave me. This was not a third-party check. It was not a double endorsed check. I am a payee on the check. XXXX XXXX XXXX would not endorse the check if I was a cent behind on my mortgage. Lawyers are not known for releasing funds if a cent is owed to them. 
I am convinced the bank manager was trying to create a new policy. Short of that. I was affected by Hurricane Irma. There have been two other hurricanes to hit the US. Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria. If TD Bank is not accepting insurance checks that is a lot of checks. Why are insurance companies issuing worthless checks if the banks are not honoring them? I was a victim once of Hurricane Irma do I have to be victimized again? Then to add insult to injury TD Bank cancelled my debit cards in what I believe is a complete retaliatory action towards me. I was on the phone to TD Bank customer service ( which by the way it took 30 minutes to even get a customer service rep, then on hold for about another half hour just so the bank manager could completely trash me to her supervisors ) when a XXXX XXXX  police officer came in and escorted me out of the bank to the amazement of pretty much everyone else in the bank ( including customers ). I am XXXX years old, and  XXXX. All this running around completely fatigued me. 
I believe I was discriminated against based on age and for being a woman. I called TD Bank customer service on Friday night when I got home, and my cards were cancelled the next day. Why the bank did that is anyones guess but I suspect it was a retaliatory action for complaining to TD bank. I wasnt robbing the bank, defrauding the bank or doing anything other than what was legal depositing a check. The bank could have done due diligence ; they did talk to my lawyer. They could have put a hold on the account, they could have contacted XXXX to check the validity but they did none of that.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,33145.0,,Consent provided,Web,2018-01-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2775746
3923,2018-01-10,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"XXXX associated complaint filed yesterday. 

This complaint involves the ongoing saga of TD Bank. 
On Friday XX/XX/XXXX after following TD Banks instructions on how to deposit an insurance check getting the check endorsed so on and so forth which I did. On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX my debit cards were cancelled without notification to me. I discovered the cards were cancelled when I was faced with an almost XXXX mob in the express checkout lane of XXXX when my cards didnt work. I was forced to return some items, scrounging around in the bottom of my purse for available cash. 
Today reluctantly XX/XX/XXXX I went into the other XXXX XXXX branch of TD bank to get new cards re-issued. I was told by telephone customer service that my accounts had not been closed. 

For some reason, the tellers were having problems printing new cards which they assured me was not due to the conflagration on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. As I was standing there a man came over. I had told the tellers a pared down version of what happened. When I starting talking about the problems with the insurance this man seemed to know who I was. 

In front of all the tellers, other customers in the bank this man started berating me for what he perceived as my misconduct. He told me he had been upstairs in the XXXX branch. I asked if he had been there why he had not chosen to come down to address the issue. He didnt seem to recognize me I had never seen him before. 
He said he was the regional marketing manager who had been supposed to contact me which he never did. He just started in on me berating me, accusing me of racism. I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had XXXX XXXX XXXX because of a bicycle accident. As by this point I had been standing for about an hour I was in pain. This man I found out XXXX XXXX just laced into me. I asked him why he chose to abuse me in front of everyone instead of taking me to a desk to talk to me alone. I told him he knew nothing about my ethnicity. Given that XXXX is 80 % XXXX, and probably 100 % immigrant he was taking a huge risk by accusing me of being racist. My lawyer is XXXX, his assistant is XXXX. I am an immigrant.He got physically confrontational putting his head inches from me backing me further into a corner by both being physically threatening and verbally abusive. I pointed out to him there were cameras all over the ceiling. I am challenged in mobility so there was not much I could do other than wait for him to stop. 

I pointed out that at this very moment in time all the staff in the bank were young male XXXX with not a woman in site. I am XXXX years old. XXXX XXXX was not the first abusive man I have ever dealt with. I did what people normally do with bullys I stood there, unable to move away, just looking at him. He was yelling at me that TD bank was going to shut down my accounts. He said I had been referred to security which was the first I ever heard of this. I asked him what I had done that had been so awful besides trying to deposit this check. He said it was because I had asked the assistant manager XXXX XXXX what her qualifications were besides not knowing what a third-party check was and what double endorsement meant. I asked him what was wrong with that. He then said it wasnt what I asked but how I asked it. I then asked what he meant by that but he refused to say what was so wrong. Its the sign of an abuser to accuse a victim of something that cant be substantiated. He was yelling at me that my behavior had been so awful that I had to be escorted out of the XXXX branch by police. He was yelling at me that I had been asked to leave and refused so the police had been called. Again, he did this in front of all the tellers. By this point they were aghast. Everyone was pale and shocked. 

I was never asked to leave on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. At the time, the police officer came in I was sitting at an empty desk talking to TD Bank customer service who had me on hold, who had returned to my call. I am not sure what the customer rep had said to me something along the line of she couldnt help me further but she terminated the call just as the police officer came in. TD Bank records calls to the call center just as they have cameras everywhere so every move, everything I said was recorded. In short, TD Bank set me up to make it look like I was the unruly customer when I had been waiting for thirty minutes just to talk to a rep. The call itself had been about 45 minutes in duration. 
XXXX XXXX said that a disagreement had occurred a year and a half ago. I asked him what that was. He wouldnt and couldnt tell me. In that time I had just returned to school and completed a XXXX XXXX in XXXX  so I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about but he made it seem that I had done something really terrible. I have no idea what he meant at all. I complained about excessive overdraft fees, some of which were refunded. Approximately 20 months ago I received a cash settlement which required the bank to check with my lawyer and I had sat in that branch for about 3 hours waiting for them to clear the funds which had been over {$10000.00} so I had no idea what he was talking about at all. 

I am not sure how TD Bank justifies this abuse. I had been in the branch yesterday XX/XX/XXXX to deposit some cash into my account. Today XX/XX/XXXX I had been patiently waiting while they printed a new debit card. I believe XXXX XXXX was trying to set me up again by talking in a belligerent tone, physically threatening me. I have been in TD bank branches many times without incident. I have been so busy in the past 20 months completing the XXXX XXXX and working that I have barely been into a branch much less away from my desk so all of this was completely bizarre. I have been working really hard to get myself an education, to get out of debt, to move on with my life even though at my age work is difficult to find. 

I believe XXXX XXXX was attempting to create an incident to justify whatever they were planning to do to me. I believe that I was treated in an awful manner because I am a middle-aged XXXX woman. I said to him that had I been a middle-aged man in a suit I would have been treated differently. XXXX XXXX said the same thing in her speech at the XXXX XXXX. He said I was talking loudly in the XXXX branch. I told him that I was losing my hearing something that is common in someone my age besides which as I was using their phone, it probably was reassuring to them that I was talking to TD Bank if they could hear me which I doubt. He was screaming at me that TD Bank was going to close my accounts, that I was going to get a letter in the mail. None of this made sense to me. He repeated asked me why I continued to bank at TD Bank. He continued to forcibly yell at me that I was not a valued customer, that I was a horrible customer, that TD Bank did not want me as a customer. He repeated this repeatedly in front of a lot of people, in front of customers who were totally perplexed to see a middle-aged man, a manager of the bank just verbally abusing me for seemingly no reason at all. There were a lot of witnesses. This was shocking even for XXXX. 
I called customer service again when I left the bank. I told them that I was in tears, that I was very upset as I have been over this whole situation. I now believe because of XXXX XXXX behavior that I have been bullied over the insurance check. I had done everything that I was required to do, I had obtained the endorsements. My lawyer had told me what TD Bank had insisted I do was not legally necessary. He had faxed a copy of his notarized signature on his letterhead as TD Bank insisted. Bullys do this. Bullys ask for impossible tasks to be fulfilled then berate their targets when this doesnt occur. This is what happened to me. I realized this as I stood there being yelled at that I was not wanted. I am like XXXX. This is a bank. This was a completely insane situation. Banking has legal implications. TD Bank was giving me grief over an insurance check that I was entitled to as a homeowner having spent a lot of my own money removing trees that had fallen on my house and caused damage. 

I have been totally discriminated against as a woman, based on age and my national origin. The biggest clue is that TD Bank had zero interest in resolving this issue. It was a check, properly endorsed and my lawyer had given me permission to deposit the check. For most of this tirade I was just looking at him, just thinking wow, if you had known the XXXX I have been through was what running through my head. 

The strange irony of the situation is that I rarely leave my house. Getting the insurance check endorsed has been the longest I have been out of my house in 20 months.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,33145.0,,Consent provided,Web,2018-01-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2776266

In a response letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo has claimed that my once mortgage loan and all modification requests were handled properly. 
I vicariously disagree and have lawyer-ed up to prove the unjust handling of my then home loan and all attempts to work out this now known predatory pick-a-payment home loan via a viable loan modification. A modification that was once afforded to all pick-a -payment loan customers via a non-hardship interest rate modification option, but later was rescinded by XXXX once the finical crisis hit and when Customers needed to exercise this option the most ( have supporting documentation of MOD option ). It is my position that in XX/XX/XXXX after falling behind on my mortgage payments I requested financial relief via a loan modification, but what I was offered was yet another destructive loan agreement that XXXX called an "" approved '' modification. This Modification did nothing to provide any sustainable financial relief, but rather placed my outstanding payments due on the back of the loan with no interest rate relief plan. In fact by accepting the "" Modification '' the stipulation was that I forfeited my rights to pursue any legal action ( have supporting documentation ). It was at this time that XXXX, now Wells Fargo, left me with no other option other than to begin legal proceeding against XXXX/Wells, in doing so Wells dragged my suit out in court over the course of several years that when Wells finally agreed to another modification consideration in XX/XX/XXXX my financial state was not as dire as it was five years ago ... Subsequently Wells neglected to revisit my XXXX modification to see if it conformed to the mandated mod agreement of the class action pick-a-payment suit settlement. Instead Wells duped me again and applied my XX/XX/XXXX financial state as a modification qualifier and thereby rejecting my request for a loan modification and appeal. Providing no Modification or outstanding loan balance relief Wells left me with an underwater loan with the same pick-a-payment rate terms that would continue to balloon as rates continued to rise leaving me with the same destructive loan. Instead of Wells working to keep, its since outlawed, pick-a-payment loan customer and his family in their home they instead looked to drive us to our imminent financial demise and damaging credit rating via their demand of foreclosure, as again there were no payment plans being offered in lieu of foreclosure.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,11731.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3152994

3973,2019-04-18,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Sued you without properly notifying you of lawsuit,"On XX/XX/XXXX I review my credit report and I decided to try to settle some debt with 2 major retailers. With XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX -XXXX, I had no issues, we discussed a reasonable settlement and monthly Payment plan and call was done. I contacted XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX  and was informed the collection was now with Midland Credit and was given the contact number of XXXX. A representative got on and said they represented XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and transferred me to the supposed Account Manager named XXXX XXXX. 

I mentioned I have a very tight budget but wanted to settle the debt for XXXX with XXXX per month for a debt of {$4400.00}. He proceeded to tell me that hed been in collections for 5 years and never settled a debt for that low. I then asked him to check with his manager in which he said he manager was busy. He then proceed to tell me I must if received a judgment letter, which I never did and very surprised since the charge off is less then a year old and I didnt know collectors can threaten with a lawsuit. I informed I never received a judgement letter! Neither by mail, certified mail, or served by officer. He continued to ask me to consent to robocalls, which I declined. 

I mentioned I never received information from them, but I was informed to contact them through XXXX   XXXX, and would like to settle the debt. He later told me the only amount theyll settle with me was XXXX and Id need to pay on that day or judgement would happen at the end of XXXX. I informed I could not settle for that amount and to go back to speak with his manager. The manager got on the phone and was very rude and disrespectful. He mentioned hed never settle for my requested amount, and would not go past XXXX, even if it was XXXX. I then informed If they have a judgment then wed have to just go to court. 

I later looked up more info on Midland Credit and came across a law firm ( XXXX ) who has had dealings with midland credit cases. I explained the situation to a representative and she asked to have the number. She then informed the number was not a typical Midland Credit contact number. But she placed me on hold, and came back and said the number is for a company Called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She suggested I find out who has the debt and that I should ask for a validation of debt. I called the number back after our call and a gentlemen answered the phone XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX but when I gave him my information he said he was from Midland Credit. I began to questioned him on who is XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, and he said he never said that, then hung up. 

The next day, XX/XX/19 I sent certified mail ( XXXX ) requesting validation of debt letter, stating I need proof of debt within 30 days or Id contact the attorney general to file complaint. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached which is not a validation of debt and continues to speak of legal action, as if I was the one threatening of which legal action. The letter I sent clearly states if I did not receive validation of debt, then Id contact the attorney generals office and FTC to file complaint, and file civil and criminal. I still have not received a validation of debt. Which I am resending the attached since Im unaware of who XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX is. If Midland is the debt collector, who is XXXX?

HISTORY OF THIS FRAUD AND HOW THEY DID IT! 

The property was quit claimed by owner XXXX XXXX over to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and to himself ( XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, exh. D1. We had a lease with an option to buy for XXXX a month, exh. E. All. before XXXX XXXX   Fraudulently Recorded an unsigned blacked out Mortgage Note exh. A. And before the so called sale to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX quit claimed it over to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, exh.  D2.

There was supposed to be a Sale Closing on the house but XXXX XXXX did not show up and XXXX XXXX did not show up because he quit Claimed the property before the so called closing date and could not be found. After arguing. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not sign the Notes and the closing Docs, but somehow the title company or some one kept the money. The Proof of this is Attorney Title Insurance Fund ( ATIF ) sued XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who was supposed to do the closing on the house. ATIF Accused them of keeping the money from the closing that did not happen with XXXX XXXX, exh FI `- F6. WHICH WAS SOMEHOW RESOLVED between XXXX XXXX and Title Insurance Company, see exh. F1. & F2. On the same day of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and a letter had came to tell us that they would not be accepting payments from us to our former bank and that it would be going to XXXX XXXX XXXX and we were making the payments to XXXX XXXX and then three months later XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure against us that we didnt know they had filed which is no Due Process and then suddenly XXXX XXXX sent a payment money back to us and then told us that they would not be accepting payments from us anymore because they were foreclosing on us but we were paying XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and we replied to them to prove their dept. exh. Z. We had no idea who XXXX XXXX was and that they were foreclosing on us, we found out Deutsche bank was assigned the note by MERS exh. H. and without Noticing the buyer as required by RESPA 12 U.S. CODE 2605 and According to F.S. 701.02 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) and also in the original fraudulent mortgage note PAGE 11 number 20 which states that the sale of the note or change of servicer the borrow must be given notice according to RESPA law 15 to 30 days Florida Statute XXXX  got the Note from XXXX XXXX   but XXXX never had a closing with XXXX XXXX.

The check deposit was originally issued from another MAJOR Financial Institution, Therefore I should have never received email threats from Whitney Bank to apply charges to my personal account because the check may not have cleared. They should have just been honest and said they didn't have the amount of funds to cash the check.

4058,2019-12-29,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have a large amount of student loan debt that I am currently in the process of paying off. 

Since I graduated a few years ago, I have been paying via the income-based repayment option ( IBR ), and making these monthly payments electronically, through Nelnet and XXXX XXXX websites and using my Chase checking account as the account to pay from. Having my account set up this way normally offers me peace of mind - my account is linked to my payments, so I will never miss a payment by accident, etc. I normally receive a monthly billing statement electronically from Nelnet ( subject line : "" Your student loan billing statement is available '' ), with no additional correspondence ; normally, I just archive these emails as I regard them as status quo. 

On XXXX XXXX, I logged into my Nelnet account on a kind of lark, because I had actually been talking to my family about my loans and wanted to take a look at my interest rates, etc. I noticed that my account was due to be auto-charged in the following days in the amount of {$2500.00} ; I wasn't sure why this was but I immediately cancelled my auto-debit information in the hopes that this was a mistake of some sort. I received a pop-up message stating that cancellation of such information takes three full days ; however, with no other options ( and it being a holiday ) I just hoped that the cancellation would take effect in time, and that the charge amount I was seeing was not actually accurate. 

Two days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I woke up to a notification from XXXX that my account balance was - {$900.00} and I realized with a sinking feeling that this payment from Nelnet had still been charged to my bank - a payment of {$2500.00}. I called Nelnet to complain but was told they considered the payment to be "" authorized '', so they could not cancel or refund it. I was charged this amount because my IBR plan had lapsed, and I did not realize that the deadline to recertify had approached. 

According to Nelnet they gave me two notifications of this - one in early XXXX to recertify, and one in early XXXX that they were about to charge me electronically. However, these notifications were only sent via email and I was not given any notice via phone call nor snail mail ; as such, these notifications absolutely did not register on my radar. ( Despite what this situation may suggest I do try to be "" on top of '' my student loans and obviously if I had known the stakes involved I would have re-certified immediately. ) On my current level of income, the amount that I was charged feels absolutely exploitative. I was given those two small notifications via email ( over several months ) but otherwise the company made very little effort to let me know of the extremely LARGE charge they were about to put on me. It overdrew my account and I had to borrow money from my mom ; if she was not able to offer me support in that moment I know overdraft fees would have continued to rack up and the impacts of this charge would continue to haunt me. 

As it stands, my savings are completely wiped out. 

I feel upset, blindsided and exploited ; it feels this series of events was designed to undercut me as a student, consumer, and citizens.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",CA,90029.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3479845

4062,2019-04-01,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"XX/XX/XXXX Hello, I enrolled at XXXX for the Fall XXXX semester. I withdrew properly and timely with the help of the VA Coordinator, XXXX XXXX. She confirmed verbally and via email my submission was received and she would take care of it from point forward. 

Months later I received an email from Nelnet, the schools tuition collection company, saying I owed tuition. XXXX had set up a payment plan for me. When you enroll at XXXX the VA coordinator sets you in front of a computer and tells you what to click, and you do it. However, I did not need, nor did I ask for tuition help. I stated I could pay it myself and expressed this to XXXX XXXX. 

Upon receipt of the bill from Nelnet, I emailed Ms. XXXX and attached the tuition statement. I had to do this three times before I had a response. Ms. XXXX in turn forwarded it to Ms. XXXX. Ms. XXXX has done nothing to help me from that point forward. I received an email from a Ms. XXXX. It was barely a full sentence : "" this did not come from XXXX ''. 

Nelnet finally explained XXXX took the tuition money and has not returned it to them, even though I had withdrawn properly. 

The only thing that would have stopped the timeliness of my withdrawal is if the school and/or Ms. XXXX failed to do their part. 

XXXX took the tuition money AFTER I had withdrawn. 
XXXX has NEVER told me they have the money. 
If Nelnet had not told me XXXX received the money I never would have found out. 

XXXX XXXX emailed that I do not owe XXXX any money. That's true, but very misleading. XXXX was paid directly by Nelnet, in my name. Nelnet only sees my name as the recipient of the tuition. However, XXXX refuses to pay that money back to Nelnet. XXXX XXXX purposely mislead me, she purposely lied to me. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have done the same thing. 

XXXX owes that money to Nelnet.

However, they are keeping it knowing full well I was not in school, knowing I withdrew in time and knowing I am being billed and harassed by Nelnet.

This is fraud. 

No one at the school would respond to any of my calls or emails for months. I had to get aggressive and make a pest of myself. XXXX, after ignoring me for months, after I had to go to the ombudsman ( which did no good ), are calling me "" disrespectful ''. Where was the respect for me, where was their help, where was their honesty? I have little respect for anyone who is knowingly committing fraud against me. 

XXXX did not think I would find out they took, and are keeping, the money from Nelnet! 

Nelnet wants their money and they will put this debt into collection soon. The debt was taken out in my name by XXXX. I was not in school, I did not use the money. I withdrew in time. XXXX should never have taken the money, or having taken it, they should have returned it. 

According to Nelnet, the proper sequence would be that XXXX pay the tuition money to me and I in turn pay Nelnet. XXXX is fraudulently keeping that money. 

I have tried to get the help of the ombudsmans office : XXXX XXXX by emailing her directly and emailing : ChancellorXXXX  to no avail. 

After submitting this I will be reaching out to the Attorney General of Florida. 
I do not owe this money. I will not pay this money and I will take XXXX to court. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX all know XXXX has committed fraud.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",FL,32958.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3197741

I stopped paying them because they refused to fix a leak which lead to XXXX  XXXX XXXX and a 10 day stay in the hospital. But that is not important but what happened next is why I need your help. 

My Condo sold at auction on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Wells Fargo started reporting to the Credit Agencies Late payments After the sale of my condo. See Below. I have contacted Wells Fargo over 100 times and contacted every Government Agency and nobody will help me. 
I have not owned the condo since XX/XX/XXXX. I can not live in it, I can not rent it, I can not sell it e I no longer OWN it so why is Wells Fargo letting a person I do not know to use MY loan and access it as their own? The auction winner had to get information regarding my loan because they paid the exact amount in XX/XX/XXXX to keep the property from foreclosing and never paid on it again. 

The Auction Winner SOLD the Condo in XX/XX/XXXX and pay off the mortgage but the damage is already done. My credit went from XXXX to XXXX and I can't even rent a refrigerator box to put on the street. 

I have asked Wells Fargo to please send me : The messages that they deleted from my Wells Fargo Secure login in their site. Requested 7 times because this shows ALL the emails I sent them to resolve this issue. I was told "" The new owner has a right to protect their asset '' REALLY? So they own it but I still have to pay the mortgage. 
I asked that they send my original contract last year. Still waiting I asked if I could give back the Condo that I had over {$100000.00} in equity in. They said NO I asked if they could foreclose on the Condo to stop the hemorrhage of my good credit. They said NO I have sent XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo over 100 emails and she still will not answer this one question. 

Why did you start reporting late payments after my Condo was sold auction on XX/XX/XXXX, and allow a third person to access and abuse my loan with Wells Fargo? 
I started complaining when XXXX XXXX notified me that I missed a payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I believe the auction winner was supposed to secure financing and pay off the 1st and 2nd liens within the 90 days after the purchase. That would explain why they did not report the late payments in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX.

4111,2019-08-09,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Please allow me to respond to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX response to CFPB ( XXXX ) and Beneficials ( HSBC ) XX/XX/XXXX response to CFPB ( XXXX ), as well as XXXX XX/XX/XXXX response to XXXX XXXX of the New York State Department of Financial Services . As the following will indicate, there remains numerous inconsistencies and concerns with both the actions of HSBC and XXXX continued and past unscrupulous actions. 
First, XXXX states, XXXX currently has the authority to process Assignment of Mortgage ( AOM ). XXXX is confident our processing of any AOMs is valid and compliant, and we find no merit to the claim of fraudulent AOMs. I disagree. Since XXXX failed to provide me a copy of the AOM, I obtained a copy myself. It lists XXXX as the assignor as Attorney In Fact for Beneficial Homeowner Service XXXX, yet no written power of attorney from Beneficial to XXXX is attached to the AOM. Does one exist? Has HSBC given XXXX Power of Attorney? The AOM was prepared and submitted by XXXX XXXX XXXX, not XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is located in XXXX XXXX, MO and XXXX is located in XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT. How does that Notary process work? Did the Notary in UT fly to MO to notarize the document prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX submitting via simplifile? The Assignee is listed as Beneficial Homeowner Service Corporation, as indenture trustee, for the holders of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, yet the allonge to the note provided in XXXX response is XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. What about XXXX Validation of Debt Notice correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating XXXX was collecting debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the investor who currently owns your mortgage loan. Additionally, HSBC states they sold the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX on numerous occasions, yet no documentation has been provided substantiating these transactions. The AOM states, For value received, the Assignor does hereby grant, sell, assign, transfer and convey, unto the above-named Assignee all interest under that certain Mortgage Dated XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$32000.00}, executed by XXXX XXXX XXXX AND XXXX XXXX XXXX, Husband AND Wife to Beneficial Homeowner Service Corporation and Recorded XX/XX/XXXX, instrument # XXXX in XXXX XXXX, State of New York. It also contains the property address as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX and absolutely no legal description of the alleged security interest. My review of said recorded mortgage indicates the mortgage has an address of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY XXXX in the amount of {$32000.00}, which are both inconsistent with the AOM XXXX allegedly legally recorded. It is my opinion, XXXX did not record the legal description because, as they have been informed, they know it neither matches the note or the mortgage making it void. However, in true XXXX fashion, they continue to misrepresent the facts in order to deceive and/or manipulate all interested parties to their benefit. They continue their Ponzi scheme in order to defraud the American public. Both the AOM and Allonge to the note is signed by XXXX XXXX, Document Control Officer. I am uncertain if this is a real individual or not. 
Secondly, XXXX states, Please be advised XXXX has requested all recorded assignments, and they will be sent under a separate cover. Ive never received, nor do I believe they even exist. 
Thirdly, XXXX states in its correspondence to the New York State Department of Financial Services, In the inquiry, Mr. XXXX requested an update on the foreclosure process on the account. Due to the status of the account, we will not be pursuing foreclosure. What is the status of the account then? Why does XXXX continue to send mortgage statements? Why has XXXX not filed a valid probate claim against the estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX? I surmise it is because there is no valid account, valid mortgage, or valid note. Additionally, this seems to be contrary to previous documentation I have received including a XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement that states, XXXX has referred your account to an attorney for legal action. 
Fourthly, XXXX states in its response to the New York State Department of Financial Services regarding property inspections, There may be occasions when more than one inspection is required, such as when an account is delinquent with limited customer contact. Its remarkably ironic, XXXX stopped inspections, forced placed insurance and sent notice of closure of an escrow account shortly after my complaint being filed. However, this does not negate the past fraudulent inspections, BPOs, forced placed insurance and misc. fees erroneously charged to the alleged account during the time preceding this complaint for a property they have no security interest or standing to enforce. 
Lastly, it is evident both HSBC and XXXX continue conspire to defraud and prey on unaware private citizens as well as state and local governments/officials and continue to go unchecked or held accountable. My attachments provide my evidentiary documentation, and as the Fiduciary for the Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I continue to dispute and reject any claims from HSBC or XXXX and affiliates.

4133,2019-02-01,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I went to pay off the total balance due on my credit card at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX branch of Citizens Bank on XX/XX/2018. I told the teller that I was there to pay off the balance on my credit card. I gave the teller {$180.00} first, which was supposed to be put towards the balance of my credit card. The remaining balance on my credit card was to be paid by my fiance through a second transaction. We asked the teller if it were easier if he were to pay the remainder from his debit card or with cash. He was alreading taking money out of the atm, and she said it would be easy to pay in cash. He paid the rest of the balance, which was the remainder ( {$160.00} ). We left that day under the impression that the card was paid off completely. 

A week and a half later I went to the bank to pay off the next round of charges which were equal to {$170.00}. The teller on that day told me that I owed over {$400.00}, and I said that couldn't be right, so she told me to call the number on the back of my credit card. I made no payments that day, because I wanted to resolve any misappropriated funds. When I called the customer service credit division, they told me to have a copy of any receipts I had from that day faxed to accounting. I went to the branch to do this, and the fax was not working that day. It was at this time we noticed that the money was deposited into a wrong account, not put towards the credit card as the teller was instructed to do. We could not find a transaction receipt for the other funds that were given to the teller to pay off the rest of the credit card. I called Customer Service of the Credit Division again that night, and was told to call them from the bank branch to help resolve the issue. 

A couple days later I went in to speak with someone about resolving the issue. It was the same teller that made the mistakes on the XX/XX/XXXX. Innitially she set up an appointment for the following XX/XX/XXXX. She cancelled that appointment and told us that a Chairman of the Board would call us because she didn't feel comfortable resolving the issue. I instead payed the {$170.00} towards the CC so that any remaining funds were those that I believed I payed off via the bank when I gave them cash to put towards the balance and also associated late fees because those payments were misappropriated. I always keep up with my payments, and if there are issues I do my best to resolve them in a timely manner. 

That week, XXXX, a chairman of the board called. She talked in circles about information I would need to provide to them. She told me to fax what receipts I had to her. She told me many times she could not reference transactions without a receipt. I wanted to at least sent her what I had, which was a copy of the receipt for {$180.00} I got for money given to the teller ... .money that was supposed to go towards paying off my CC balance, but instead was accidently deposited by the teller into someone else 's account ( I did not authorize a deposit of {$180.00}, it was supposed to be a payment towards my CC balance ). We could not locate the other transaction, and though someone from Customer Service in the Credit Division told me that the bank should be able to locate it through the records from the day, XXXX seemed unable and unwilling to help without that specific transaction information. I told her I would fax the information I had over and she assured me 3 times that she would call me the following Wednesday to touch base no matter what. 

I faxed the receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX tried calling on XX/XX/XXXX but I was unavailable. I waited for her call on XX/XX/XXXX and did not receive one. I even called her office around XXXX to try to reach her, but got her answering machine. I also called XX/XX/XXXX and got no response, no call back. I then called XX/XX/XXXX and left a message again. I reached out to the Customer Service line once more and XXXX assured me he would let XXXX know I was trying to reach her. 

XXXX finally called back later on XX/XX/XXXX. I was so frustrated by this point, having poured many hours into resolving this issue. XXXX told me that the receipt that I sent was a deposit into someone else 's account and that she would need proof I was making a payment towards my credit card. Well, if the teller hadn't made a mistake then I would have the proper information, but this is one of the reasons I was calling. The money wasn't put towards the credit card, as I instructed the teller to do. I was so frustrated at this point and heated, I resolved to reach out to consumer finance to file a complaint. I should not have so much trouble trying to resolve this. 

Whether this was a mistake or intentional misappropriation of funds by the teller, the bank has done little to help me actually resolve this issue. The bank doesn't even seem to care that the teller made mistakes, telling me they can't do anything to help me. That is why I am reaching out to the CFPD. 

I hope that the CFPD can assist me in resolving this issue. I have had good standing with the bank so far and I do not wish this to negatively affect my credit.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",MA,2360.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3140170

4143,2019-02-21,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"TD Bank Mortgage is accusing me of being in bankruptcy. My monthly mortgage statements contain the following notice : "" Our records show that either you are a debtor in bankruptcy or you discharged personal liability for your mortgage loan in bankruptcy. '' Neither of these accusations is factual. I brought this error to the attention of TD Bank and filed a CFPB complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX CFPB # XXXX ) raising this specific issue. In their CFPB response, TD Bank agreed to correct this error. Although TD Bank demanded a generous timeframe to address this issue, they have done nothing to correct this error. It has been over eight months since I raised this new issue. Nothing! 

I am not in bankruptcy and have not been involved in any bankruptcy proceedings since XX/XX/XXXX. My personal liability for this mortgage with TD Bank was not discharged. My liability has never been discharged for  any mortgage. Over the last three years, I have made repeated requests for TD Bank to correct their records. To this day, TD Bank has not corrected their own records and they are still accusing me as noted above. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX, TD Bank began accusing me of being in bankruptcy. They locked me out of my mortgage account, stopped sending my mortgage statements and destroyed my credit. TD Bank refused to speak to me until I filed my first CFPB complaint. TD Bank later took punitive action against me by attacking my credit profile. They added negative remarks to my credit profile, which they knew ( or should have known ) by regulation to be greatly outdated. It took two years and multiple complaints & credit disputes for TD Bank to correct the worst of the errors in my credit profile. For two years TD Bank unfairly prevented me from opening new lines of credit. Although the TD Bank portion of my credit profile still does not accurately represent my excellent payment history, I have not raised that issue lately because of the risk of further retaliation. At this time, it is most important that TD Bank stop accusing me of being in bankruptcy. 

Over the last three years of mortgage mismanagement, TD Bank has blamed inaccurate dates, incorrect coding, and TD Banks failure to correctly enter XX/XX/XXXX reaffirmation agreement information as causes to accuse me of being in bankruptcy. They have acknowledged the errors and agreed to fix them. But, they either never make corrections or they make additional errors instead of corrections. In TD Banks response to this complaint, I expect, they will again dredge-up outdated information about my XX/XX/XXXX bankruptcy, implying that this old info is relevant today. It is not relevant in servicing this mortgage in the present. An XXXX year old bankruptcy does not give them the right to accuse me of being in bankruptcy now. 

These errors in TD Bank records have been brought to their attention a long time ago. No matter how TD Bank spins this complaint, there is no excuse for known errors in my TD Bank Mortgage files to have gone unfixed for so long. There is no excuse for TD Bank to be accusing me of being in bankruptcy. 
In the above mentioned CFPB complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX CFPB # XXXX ) into this error, the TD Bank response letter contained contact info for XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX. I made multiple attempts to contact each of them. Neither employee would accept or return my calls.

( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NY,11223.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3322235

4191,2019-01-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) acquired my mortgage including servicing beginning on or about XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage was previously originated and serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX. At origination and at the time of the acquisition/servicing transfer to SLS, the loan was only escrowed for property taxes. It was not for insurance as the condominium master policies were provided at origination and were sufficient for closing. It is extremely important to note that my loan was originated without a requirement or condition for me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. 
On XX/XX/XXXX SLS claims to have sent me a first notice of expiration of a condominium unit owners policy. I never received the first notice from SLS. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS sent me a second notice which I did receive. Shortly thereafter I called and verbally spoke to SLS loan servicing department to inform them that my loan was originated without an HO-6 policy and that it was not required at origination. SLS was only able to respond that the HO-6 policy was required by law in Florida. I informed them that it was required in Florida in XXXX but an amendment was made to the Florida laws in XXXX in which the requirement was removed. The SLS representative did not take the time to consider the correct information I relayed to her and just kept saying that HO-6 insurance was required in Florida. I then called a second time to see if I could speak to a rationale person at SLS and again communicated to SLS that it erroneously was requiring me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. Again I explained to the representative that Florida laws were amended in XXXX and that any explicit requirement that condominiums must have an HO-6 policy was removed. Since the SLS representative continued to communicate to me that Florida law requires me to have an HO-6 policy, I specifically asked the representative to have SLS Legal send me evidence that Florida had such a requirement. The representative stated that someone would research and call me back. On XX/XX/XXXX a SLS representative named XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be wrong ) left me a voicemail requiring me again to have an HO-6 policy and to send evidence of an HO-6 policy. She also stated that it was Required by the State of Florida which is not correct. I have this voicemail saved as evidence that SLS gave me incorrect and misleading information. Although I requested it, SLS never provided me in writing any legal citation that I was required in the state of Florida to maintain an HO-6 insurance policy. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS force placed insurance costing {$5100.00} covering XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. This amount of force placed insurance impacted my monthly loan payment. My loan payment increased {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) from {$1600.00} to {$2900.00} based on an escrow analysis completed by SLS which was immediately enforced. Even though I did not have any prior damage to my property or any claims, they placed insurance retroactively for the entire year at an egregious cost of {$5100.00} when the market cost of HO-6 policies is approximately $ 600- {$700.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX SLS then renewed the forced placed HO-6 policy at an even higher cost of {$5600.00}. This new policy is a whopping 10 % higher than the prior policy which was force placed just 2 months prior. I ended up getting my own HO-6 policy for the sole purpose of reducing my required escrow amount and monthly payment to escrow until this issue was resolved and NOT because of any Florida requirement because one does not exist. My cost of getting an HO-6 policy was {$590.00}, approximately 89 % less than what SLS charged my escrow account.

In the end, I believe the actions of SLS violate the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which requires covered persons or service providers such as SLS to refrain from committing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. SLS force placed an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan on the premise that it was required by Florida law as SLS representatives stated in a voicemail message which I saved and can provide. The citation of that law could not be provided by SLS when requested. Therefore it is contended that no such legal requirement exists for my loan. In addition, no such requirement was in place at the time of my loan origination and, therefore, no such requirement can arbitrarily be imposed on my loan by SLS at its leisure. As such, the act of SLS of incorrectly force placing an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan was an UNFAIR act in that 1 ) it caused me direct and substantial injury since my monthly payment immediately increase by {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) per month and I had to eventually get my own HO-6 policy which I was not required to obtain 2 ) it was not avoidable by me ; even though I attempted to resolve the matter with SLS prior to the force placement, SLS did not act appropriately and continued with the erroneous force placement ; furthermore, if I did not pay the increased escrow amount, then SLS would have reported negatively and incorrectly to the credit bureaus which would have created yet another regulatory violation ( of FCRA ) on their behalf 3 ) my financial injury was in no way outweigh by any benefit of having the HO-6 policy ; in fact, the first policy was retroactive 11 months from the date it was purchased ; since I had no events or claims during those 11 months then the benefit of the policy was solely for SLS, NOT the customer ; in addition, since the HO-6 policy is not a legal requirement, then I do not believe the benefits of the policy costing approximately 89 % more than the typical market price outweigh its costs.

The acts of SLS were also DECEPTIVE in that 1 ) I the consumer ( and potentially other consumers ) was mislead by SLS as an SLS personnel made an explicit Representation to me that the HO-6 policy was required by Florida law. I have subsequently consulted 2 separate law firms and both have informed me that Florida law was amended in XXXX and as a result there is no such explicit requirement that I have an HO-6 policy on my condominium ; furthermore, since I requested SLS to provide me evidence that a Florida requirement for the insurance existed and SLS did not provide evidence of such legal requirement, then SLS may have Omitted material information ; 2 ) since my loan was originated without the requirement of an HO-6 insurance policy and without the requirement to place funds in escrow for the purpose of purchasing an HO-6 policy, then my belief that an HO-6 policy was not required is reasonable 3 ) the misleading act by  SLS is material The acts of SLS were also ABUSIVE in that I that consumer placed reasonable reliance on SLS to act in my interest. However, SLS did not adequately perform its responsibilities in understanding Florida law and did not provide me with the evidence and citation of the Florida law SLS referred to in its voicemail probably because the requirement does not exist ; SLS was in a position to take advantage of me as I felt I did not have any other avenue to gain clarity on the matter and resolve it except for getting my own legal advice. 

Should this formal complaint not be resolved to a mutual satisfaction, I will have no choice but to proceed with formal legal action.

4221,2019-10-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/2019, I opened a checking account, online, through TD Bank. Within several days of opening the account, I set up the account to receive direct deposits from my employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX. In the time-frame of about a week, I became locked out of accessing the online capabilities for the account, however, I have other checking accounts and this particular one didn't have any funds in it yet, so it was not of urgency to have the matter resolved right away. The XXXX direct deposit system, through my employer, typically take two pay periods before funds get deposited into a newly added account. Sometime around the week of XX/XX/XXXX, a week prior to being able to receive a direct deposit to my new TD Bank checking account, I called their customer service to see if I could resolve the online banking issue over the phone.The representative stated I would need to go to a local TD Bank Branch to confirm my identity and gave no further explanation. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$1000.00} from my employer was deposited into this checking account, and I visited a local branch to have my online access unlocked. It was at this time I was informed my account was in a "" closed '' status, due to fraudulent activity, and that I needed to provide my social security card to confirm my identity. At that time the only identification I was able to provide was my Florida issued driver 's license as well as a US Passport. I was told this was not sufficient and that the only way the "" closed '' status could be lifted was by providing my social security card. I visited another branch that day and the representative I spoke with confirmed the same information, that my account was "" closed ' and that I'd need to provide my social security card to verify my identity. In addition, I was informed that the issue with my account had been escalated to a different department -- this is a department I still have not gotten any specific information about, other than they don't have a direct phone number and are currently investigating my account. The representative I spoke with that day informed me that since my account was "" closed '' and the funds from my employer were only initiated and not deposited, that the direct deposit would kick back to the employer. I contacted my payroll department about the issue and they stated that once they received rejection of the funds they could issue me a check. The following Monday, I went to the branch again, this time providing my Florida issued driver 's license, US Passport, current car registration and a piece of mail in my name, confirming my address. Again, this was not sufficient, however this time I was told my account wasn't "" closed '', but rather in a "" no check status '' and that the funds had been deposited into my account with no way of reversal or retrieval from my employer. Again, I contacted customer service, this time being informed that my account was neither "" open '' nor "" closed '' but rather in a "" restricted '' status. Nobody at the branch or through the customer service number could provide me any information or put me in direct contact with anyone investigating the matter, only that I needed to visit a branch in person to resolve the issue. On another instance, I was informed by a customer service representative via telephone that even though my account was restricted, my funds should be rejected and sent back to my employer within 6 business days, which has proven inaccurate. On two separate instances, at different branches, I've asked to speak with branch managers at TD Bank and have been told there were none there. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I made a final attempt to have the issue resolved at a local branch. The main identifying piece of information they are requesting is confirmation of my social security number, so came with my Florida issued license, US Passport, current car registration, piece of mail with my current address, W2 forms from the past 3 years, that clearly show my social security number, the paystub from the direct deposit to their institution -- placed on XX/XX/2019, as well as my receipt from the Social Security Administration, showing my order being processed for a replacement social security card. The response I received from the representative I spoke with was that they were able to confirm my identity, however, my account was currently under investigation for fraud, by a department they weren't able to get in contact with, and that there was nothing I could do to get the {$1000.00} that has been sitting in the account for the last 12 days. The gentlemen informed me to call the number on the back of my debit card, since there was nothing he could do to lift the hold on my account. I asked him, in the event I provide my social security card once it arrives, if then I'd be able to access the account, and his response was no. I called that number on the back of my debit card and the customer service representative stated that my account was "" locked '', he couldn't see/or have access to any information about it and that I'd need to go to a branch to have the issue resolved. At this point I have no other alternative but to file a complaint since I'm not getting any clear answers or resolution dealing directly with this institution.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,33136.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3398810

4228,2019-03-15,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Add-on products and services,"The Card Security program with Synchrony Bank is a complete scam. I made a complaint previously but the situation has only gotten worse since, with their continued refusal to make a good faith effort to pay claims warranting a new complaint. It's hard to know where to even start. After finally getting the benefit form from Synchrony, which I had to demand MULTIPLE TIMES, they processed my application. It shows that it was approved. I received NO INFORMATION on the approval, I received NO INFORMATION regarding the payments I was approved for and I received NO INFORMATION on any further steps. 

The only reason I knew I was approved is because the online portal showed "" approved ''. NO FURTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED. I then call into the call center to get more information. The first two times, I get people who are clearly incompetent and can give me no further information. The last call I made, today XX/XX/XXXX, the woman tells me that they will make two additional "" courtesy '' payments. She can not tell me the amount of the payments, only that they will post "" after my statement closes '' which will be AFTER MY DUE DATE creating a late payment. Apparently, them paying late and putting customers ' credit history at risk IS SO COMMON THAT THEY ADJUST THE LATE FEES BUT DO NOT FIX THE CREDIT REPORT. How horrible is it that people pay for insurance only to find out their credit history may still be harmed? That the company has such a disregard for their customer that they pay late? 

Then she told me that there is MORE PAPERWORK to fill out after the 90 days. What paperwork? She can't give me further information now. When will I receive it? She doesn't know. In fact, she looks and it shows in their internal system that I have received NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEYOND A BENEFIT FORM AT ALL. There is no more information to be had except that my payment will post after the statement closing date - making it late for an UNDETERMINED AMOUNT that may even be less than my minimum. 

This is the worst part - all agents then advise me that, even though my claim has been approved and, even though their program says they will make the minimum payment - I SHOULD CONTINUE MAKING MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IF I DON'T THE ACCOUNT MAY DEFAULT. THEY ADMIT THAT THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM AND MAY NOT MAKE THE PAYMENTS PROMISED. 

This company needs to be shut down. There is no hope. It is my understanding the CFPB has already fined them for this scam, please know they are put this scam on full throttle now, charging a large premium and leaving customers with UNPAID BILLS, LATE PAYMENTS, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF PAPERWORK AND NO CORRESPONDENCE ON WHAT FURTHER INFORMATION IS NEEDED FOR A CLAIM APPROVAL. 

Synchrony should be ashamed of it self for preying on the vulnerable and the CFPB should be ashamed of itself for not shutting them down when it had the chance.

4232,2019-03-18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I had a mortgage with Well Fargo Home Mortgage on a home that I sold in early XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, at my current home address I received a letter from Wells Fargo enclosing a check in the amount of {$1300.00} relating to Private Mortgage Insurance. The letter does not include specific information about calculation of the amount of the refund. Wells Fargo 's customer service representatives at the number provided in the letter as the number to call in the event of any question were unable to provide helpful information. 

The letter states ( 1 ) Wells did not include the option to cancel PMI on the date the principal balance reaches 80 % of the original value of the property, and ( 2 ) PMI was previously removed from my account and I was no longer required to pay any further premiums, payments or other fees related to PMI. 

Wells describes the calculation of the refund as follows : "" The refund is for PMI payments you made from the date we gave you the incorrect information to whichever of the following came first : ( 1 ) the date we provided the correct information [ or ] ( 2 ) the date you were no longer required to carry PMI. '' The letter further states that Wells is paying interest I would have earned on the amount of the refund. There is no explanation of any of the calculations or the dates used in connection therewith. 

The letter includes a toll free number and the only mailing address listed is a Return Mail Operations address. When I called the toll free number the Wells representative initially was unable to locate any information about the matter because it involves a closed mortgage account. I was transferred to a supervisor who was able to verify that the check in the amount of {$1300.00} had been issued, but he was unable to provide any further information. He provided me with a mailing address and a fax number for Wells Fargo 's Written Correspondence Department. Both representatives tried to be helpful, but lacked access to helpful information. 

I appreciate the refund. It may be the correct amount. I would like to understand how Wells Fargo arrived at the amount. The letter 's statement that "" PMI was previously removed from your account and you were no longer required to pay any further premiums, payments or other fees related to PMI, '' followed by the statement that Wells Fargo is providing a refund, is vague. I want to know whether Wells Fargo collected PMI payments from me for some period of time after PMI had actually been removed from my account. If this is the case, the refund should include all overpayment amounts, irrespective of the date ( s ) of  any notice ( s ) to me. 

I need more information in order to determine whether Wells Fargo 's refund is sufficient to cover the amount by which I overpaid Wells Fargo. I am submitting this request instead of a written request to Wells Fargo 's Written Correspondence Department because this process, which includes a web portal, is easier than the process Wells Fargo has offered.

I gave well Fargo all the information need it, I demanded Wells Fargo to check the bank security camera where would easily show that I never been in this bank, the bank answered me that they did not have enough evidence that the transaction was unauthorized.The manager of the place where I used to live is a witness, he saw the person stealing from my home, my boyfriend is also witnessed, this person has many criminal records, there is a video in weel Fargo where will show this person on the bank, however for the bank conveniently all that is no enough evidence, so I wonder then what is enough evidence to Wells Fargo? 
Their decision was based only on assumption without any real proves of facts and they arrived to the conclusion that the transaction was made by me. They base their negligent decision in a poor investigation based in nothing factual, they told me because I live nearby the location from where the money was taken, and because my bank account was inflated the day before, and because there was no attempt of using other pins, the criminal was a friend of my roommate that spend some nigth at the house, my answer to all that : I was victim of robber by a person that my roommate used to trust that is not my fault, who he got my exact pin number I don't have idea, that is not my busyness, I did not give to him, I don't authorize him to go the bank, I did not plane to steal from myself. Your decision of this claim have deeply humiliated me, you made me feel like thief, am suffering great pain, I was the victim and you have the power to prove it, but you insist in not to release the security camera from your bank, you are ignoring facts and you pretend to blame me, the victim for something that you should protect me, .I will no rest until bringing justice to this matter. 
I demand you release the bank security cameras.that is the ultimate prove, and to give me back the XXXX dollars stoles from me, and to hear from the witness that I mentioned before, now all of them are ready to come forward in my defense and they are ready to testify in any place. 
I will not let this bank get away after to treat me like a second class citizen. 
This is the last chance for you to do the right thing, my witness and I we are willing to go to tv station and find for a lawyer. 

if you are so sure that you are right then why you don't give me a copy of the bank security camera, that will prove that you are wrong and that you must pay the money stolen. To me all this situation is unfair and deeply dishonest from your part.

4282,2020-06-09,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"My name is XXXX XXXX I am Barclays Arrival+ card holder. I am writing in regard to unauthorized charges on my account and unfair treatment by Barclays fraud investigations representatives and denial of fair investigation of my case. 

In early XXXX there were unauthorized transactions on my credit card, as I found out about it I have reached out to Barclays right away and have let them know about unauthorized transactions. In that conversation I have mentioned that the card was most likely stolen from my car, thats where I believe I had it. I was asked few questions and then I think I have asked representative if I need to file police report. To what representative told me that I dont need to file it. The credit for unauthorized charges was issued. On XX/XX/XXXX I have left for my month-long business trip to XXXX, returning on XX/XX/XXXX. I have prove of my absence in my passport showing stamps of entering and exiting XXXX countries. In my absence there was a mail sent that was asking me to affidavit that the card was stolen, and that I dont know the person who did still it. I have sent that document in few days after my arrival to USA and saw that the earlier credit was reversed. Then I tried reaching Barclays in regards to that reversal, and at that time it was full blown pandemic and I couldnt reach anyone. After numerous calls I was able to reach someone at customer support and they told me that fraud investigations department is closed due to Covid-19. I have asked if I can pay this card now as I have few days left before past due date and then keep disputing charges. Customer service rep told me yes that this shouldnt be an issue and that it will not have affect on my dispute. 

Three weeks ago, I was finally able to reach to fraud investigations department and spoke with XXXX. XXXX has advised me then to file a police report and send it with letter. I am 99 % sure that on first call when I reported unauthorized activity I also asked if I need to file a police report, but was told that Barclays doesnt need it. Now 3 months later Barclays is asking for police report and police says that its too late and that they cant do investigation as car was washed and most evidences where removed from car by now. In case if I even didnt ask why you waited for so long to request a police report, you deal with such situations on the daily bases and request a police report only 3 months later knowing that its too late to obtain that police report. I was supposed to be advised on first call to obtain the police report. Arent you dealing with such cases on daily bases, and if police report is one of major documents for this investigation why instead of encouraging me to obtain one you rep told me not to get one? 

Then I placed multiple more calls trying to understand why this credit was reverted and how I can get fair assessment of this dispute. However, when I reached out to fraud investigation, rep told me that there was a valid charge on the account and right away I told its mistake. Right away I reviewed my account and there was a valid charge which is your annual membership fee. So yes, it is valid charge automatically charged by Barclays every year, but what I have to do with it? Then I had another call, when I tried to explain that its absurd to use automatic annual fee charge as bases to deem fraudulent transactions as authorized. Then new rep by name of XXXX told me that there were other transactions in XXXX that were not approved after unauthorized transactions and that those were deemed valid as thats what I have said to some rep on the phone. I disagree with that as I remember this conversation and that I told specifically that my card was stolen and when rep asked if those transactions were valid, I asked what she means, and she asked if the card was present when transaction were made? To what I replied probably as they have my card and the transaction would go through only with chip. In this context it was obvious that I was referring to them stilling my card and physically using it. But Barclays chose to shuffle the words and make representation that I have said that the charges made after unauthorized charges are authorized. There is a difference between card present and authorized charges, this is misrepresentation and almost fraud! Then XXXX the rep told me, why did you pay then if it wasnt you who made those charges? I wouldnt pay it if it wasnt my charges. What a great way to back the validity of the argument! Well, I paid because I care about my XXXX credit score and because I will need my credit history throughout my life and there is nothing wrong with me paying it not to be reported late and continue to pursue fair resolution of this investigation. I placed multiple other calls with Barclays and every time I was given really ridiculous reasons why these charges are valid and dispute cant be reopened. For example, I spoke with rep XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that those charges are valid because XXXX was able to verify me. When I asked how XXXX verified me, she replied that my name was on the receipt. Well, I told her that card has my name on it and my signature on the back so how does that make this verified transaction? She told me that my signature/name is verified and matching. I told her that this is impossible and asked her to review that signature, when she pulled up receipt, she told me there is no name or signature on the receipt. Then she told me that apple verified me by my social security number. And quite honestly, its just a ridiculous misrepresentation because every household has an apple product and never anybody had to verify they social security number to make a purchase at XXXX. This is huge misrepresentations and to some extend fraud if not to big extend. 

All that being said, I have an extraordinary amount of stress being caused to me with this unfair investigation and misrepresentations of Barclays employees basically accusing me in fraud while misrepresenting facts and committing fraud themselves. And based on my recent conversation with manager XXXX he understood the situation and advised me to write 2 letters, one to fraud investigations department and another one to executive office. He told me that the case most likely will be reopened and will be given fair assessment. I am writing this letter to request a fair investigation and to assign a single contact person to my case that would be able to examine the entire case and listen to all phone conversations and see what really is true and whats not. Also all reps at Barclays need a better training to resolve fraud issues, however it looks like they were trained to brush clients off with giving 100 misrepresentations to back the denial of dispute. Please be advised that if you will deny me in reopening my case and fair investigation of it. I will turn to CFPB, governor XXXX and senator XXXX to protect my rights. And if they will not be able to help me, I will file a law suite against Barclays Card and sue for unauthorized charges, stress that I had to go through, loss of time, interest on my money and legal fees for attorney. Will also get the press involved telling the story of how I was mistreated and what ridiculous statements were made by your reps.

Things in my house hold got complicated when my partner had health issues and was unable to work. Back then I put in for a loan modification and was going through the process and XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to another Mortgage Company. The mortgage company I believe was XXXXXXXX XXXX at the time, since then it has been taking over once again by Fay Servicing which has been next to impossible to deal with. I never was contacted from them up until the time when I received a certified letter on a auction date of my house. I went online to their web page and looked at my account and the personal information they had was incorrect and they had a do not call applied to my account for some reason. At this time I reached out to Fay and gave them my correct information and made it clear that I had funds and I wanted to work with them to straighten out my mortgage. They continued pressing with foreclosure with an auction date scheduled and I was unable to get written documentation from them as to pull the money out of a 401k account that I have. Last minute I was forced to go hire an attorney in file for bankruptcy to postpone the auction in order to give me enough time to get proper documentation to pull out a hardship against my 401k. Without receiving documentation I received another letter of foreclosure for auction date slated XX/XX/XXXX, once again as in many times I called Fay Servicing for information on my mortgage and documention of amount due. I did not receive documentation 4 weeks until I finally received it and sent in my application to my 401k company. The paperwork got tied up with my 401 and was waiting on electronic transfers for money into my account to be able to bring my mortgage up-to-date. Called Fay services as well as faxed over all documentation I had of guaranteed funds and they refused to cancel auction in allow me the opportunity to bring my account to date or pay off Mortgage in full, was told that they refuse to cancel auction and are pressing forward with foreclosure which did happen. At the auction no certified bidders were present other than myself and was told it would go back to Fay services which I could deal with and try to resolve this issue once again.

I have disputed this account formation as being merged and therefore inaccurate but Equifax has come back stating these were verified. How is this possible? 

It is abundantly clear that these two trade lines are merged. It is impossible that two separate trade lines will have exact same account numbers, exact same past due amount and the exact same creditor address. That in itself should have been more than enough to alert Equifax that the information reported was inaccurate and warranted deletion. My previous CFPB compliant is attached. By continuing to report these inaccurate trade lines Equifax has caused undue damage to my credit worthiness and as a result I have been denied credit or have had credit extended at higher rates that I otherwise would have qualified for had the two trade lines above been properly addressed by Equifax. 

Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : I have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information CRAs ( Equifax ) must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information within 30 days CRAs ( Equifax ) may not report outdated negative information I may seek damages from CRAs ( Equifax ) and credit reporting data furnishers ( XXXX  ) for FCRA violations I contend that Equifax did not perform due care in its investigation of the two trade lines and rubber stamped them as accurate. I am sure this occurred as a result of Equifax being understaffed due to Covid-19. This is evident by Equifaxs drastic cutting of phone support ; however this does not preclude Equifax from meeting FCRA requirements. In addition if the information from these two trade lines were being correctly reported the XXXX XXXX / XXXX trade line would not appear on my credit report at all. This is due to FCRA statute of limitations. This trade line has already been rightfully removed from my XXXX  and XXXX  reports for this very reason. 

This is a clear case of Equifax being in violation of the FCRA. I strongly urge Equifax to immediately remove these two trade lines or I will be left with no choice but to file suit with the intent of reaching class action status. The only acceptable resolution to this matter is for Equifax to delete these two trade lines immediately. 

While I prefer not to litigate, I will utilize the courts and publicity to enforce my rights under the FCRA and seek monetary damages. 


I look forward to swift resolution of this matter.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TN,38027.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2020-04-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3614079

I thought this was already cleared and I do appreciate your professionalism and follow-up calls but if you verbally and indicate on paper that both accounts are cleared, it should be cleared. I should not spend any more time on this yet I have already spent a total of 2.5 hours already! I ended work early to enjoy my extra 4 hours off but spent most of it on this matter! I am sorry for the frustration but I am so upset about this.  It's already been about 1 month since the XXXX XXXX XXXX has been opened and I am unable to use it despite sending in personal and quite dangerous security documents to you nearing 3 weeks. Please help I am tired of calling customer service reps that provide false reassurances and no follow-ups.e )",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,CA,91784.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3282022

4362,2019-03-20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"I opened a checking account with BB & T for my business online on XX/XX/2019 and I tried to open a savings account too for any overdraft issues but I had to visit a local branch to do that which it prompted me during the application that I can not choose to have overdraft protection since my account is not eligible due to not linking a savings account. Furthermore it asked if I wanted to opt in for overdraft coverage and I declined it. 3 days later I called and spoke to a representative who then connected me with her supervisor since they havent received my signature card yet to verify the deposit I was going to have withdrawn from my current bank to open the savings will go back to the account it came from and to make sure I was not opted in for overdraft coverage. The supervisor told me that I am not opted in and the money would be returned, which it was so I assumed the overdraft coverage was correct too. 
On XX/XX/19 there was an overdraft charge however, I didnt notice it and then on XX/XX/19 there were multiple charges, yet again I wasnt aware of it since I hadnt switched over to using that account as my main business checking and had only made a couple deposits and withdrawals. On XX/XX/19 a deposit for {$2200.00} was put into the account and I paid some bills with it and little did I know that BB & T had taken {$800.00} from the deposit on the XXXX in overdraft fees. I called and waited on hold a couple times, one time I was disconnected during a transfer and nobody called me back and the other time I was on hold for over an hour. I knew this was a mistake since I called and verified that I wanted no overdraft coverage so I never imagined there would be such an issue returning the fees. I had set up a couple items through BillPay in this account before these fees arose, there was a reoccurring payment that was sent out while my account was {$800.00} negative and returned which then started this process all over again, how it has spiraled into {$1200.00} in overdraft fees within a month is beyond me. Ive depostied {$3800.00} in the account, Ive had {$3400.00} in transactions from the account and yet I have some how accumulated over {$1200.00} in overdraft fees. I spoke with a representative named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX who told me he sees I opted out of overdraft protection but by default I have overdraft review, when I explained to him that I specifically called in and stated there isnt supposed to be any type of overdraft coverage, including overdraft protection or review he said I opted out of those but not overdraft review decision, I explained that nowhere in my paperwork or on their website do I see that verbiage regarding my account and I asked to speak with a supervisor. He argued with me as to why I didnt need a supervisor for 40 mins after telling me that if I didnt have overdraft coverage, any time I used my card and it was declined I would be charged a {$37.00} fee for the decline. Finally he said he would transfer me and the call was disconnected again during the transfer to a supervisor. I call back and spend another hour on the phone talking to a supervisor named XXXX, who said he believes there is a error or glitch that didnt take the overdraft coverage off and the research dept is going to investigate this matter and get back with me. He assured me they would listen to the phone calls and review all the documents and computer logins during this investigation. At the end of the phone call I was satisfied knowing that a department was going to look into this and what I stated to them would be proven. I followed up after not hearing anything on XX/XX/XXXX and realizing they are still charging my account daily and the return checks were still going through creating more fees and XXXX advised me that it would take up to 30 days. I call again yesterday and talk to XXXX XXXX in Executive Dept. who told me that the case number XXXX gave her hasnt been pulled for review yet ( this was at XXXX XXXX est ) this morning at XXXX XXXX est I received a call from XXXX who said she was with the research dept and she looked into my case and they determined I owe the fees. When I advised XXXX there was no way she really researched my case since the file wasnt pulled yesterday at XXXX and the department she works in is only open from 8-5, how could she have really researched anything in 20 mins when Ive spent at least 10 hours on the phone being told different information. She refused to give me her last name, supervisors name or a rep id and hung up on me. This morning I spoke with XXXX XXXX, a supervisor over the executive dept. who never returned my calls and said she couldnt access her voicemail but would look into my account today. I explained to her that I am getting charged daily and asked her when I would hear back since this was supposed to be done a week ago and she laughed at me and said if you expect me to listen to 10 hours of calls then you will have to give me some time I responded that {$1200.00} in fees isnt really something I find funny or constantly being blown off every time I have called to resolve this, which has taken up 10 hours of my time this month and my contractors whos checks were returned because you guys have falsely accumulated {$1200.00} in fees definitely doesnt find this funny either. She quickly changed her tone and said she would follow up with me at the end of the day. The bank is closed and I never heard anything from her. Ive requested to have the fees reimbursed and after all of the phone calls, XXXX XXXX confirmed through email yesterday that my account is still opted in for overdraft coverage! Not one of 4 representatives or 3 supervisors has yet to correct my account to this very day.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BB&T CORPORATION,OH,43220.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3186294

4366,2019-11-20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXXat XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage was Modified and I established Automatic Draft payment arrangements with XXXX XXXX and paid my payments on time every month. The OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE or Interest Bearing Principal balance of {$26000.00} was due to be paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX since the Outstanding Principal Balance on that Loan Statement was only {$78.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed my mortgage payment of {$480.00} check # XXXX to cover my payment due XX/XX/XXXX. This should pay in full the Interest Bearing Principal Balance of my Modified Mortgage and satisfy my Escrow account. The next mortgage that should be due on XX/XX/XXXX should begin the amortization process for the DEFERRED PRINCIPAL BALANCE of {$110000.00} AND MY PAYMENTS SHOULD CONTINUE as outlined in my HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT, a copy of which I provided to loan care on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. 
LOAN CARE A Service Link Company has been servicing my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX and assigned me a LOAN # XXXX. I have always paid on time automatically and directly from my checking account until XX/XX/XXXX when they automatically withdrew a significantly larger than the agreed upon amount from my checking account without my permission and without clarification. Effective XX/XX/XXXX with check # XXXX for {$480.00} I started writing my own checks. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called Loan Care to inquire why my payment was not posted for XX/XX/XXXX to pay off the OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE/Interest Bearing Principal Balance of my mortgage of {$78.00}. That was when I was told that Loan Care MADE AN ERROR AND PLACED MY PAYMENT IN A "" SUSPENSE '' ACCOUNT. 
I did not receive a bill for my payment due XX/XX/XXXX to begin paying off the DEFERRED BALANCE OF {$110000.00} that appears on my monthly mortgage statement. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX I have become a victim of ongoing ROBO CALLS from Loan Care Collection Department, I have been the victim of abusive servicing practices and for the past 10 months of calling, writing, continuing to pay my mortgage on time Loan Care has continued to take my payments and place them into as "" suspense '' account rather than to apply them properly and correct their error. Loan Care has placed me on a daily automated unattended collection call telling me that my account is delinquent. They have sent an un-marked car to my house on a Sunday with an unidentified note saying that I must pay my mortgage. Loan Care has returned my mortgage payments made XX/XX/XXXX for {$510.00} my check # XXXX for payment due XX/XX/XXXX  and also on XX/XX/XXXX they sent to me their check # XXXX for {$510.00} saying it was an amount from their escrow account. 
I have returned the payment back to Loan Care for {$510.00} by my check # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXXalong with an additional check for {$510.00} # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX to make my payment due XX/XX/XXXX. In addition to continuing to make my monthly payments.

Loan Care has reported delinquent debts on my credit report causing terrible effects on my other creditors who have started reducing credit commitments that they have made to me as a result of Loan Care 's derogatory credit reporting. My monthly mortgage statements from Loan Care are all full of errors.

When I realized that I am dealing with a situation that is out of my control, I drove up to where the office was for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX XXXX to see of someone could help, but the company was no longer there. I reached out to my XXXX County County Commissioner, I called the office of the President of the USA, I sought direction from my fellow mortgage professionals, I sought direction and help from my pastor, and I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I am a SENIOR CITIZEN and have become the victim of abusive servicing practices by Loan Care. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted a law firm and paid them {$250.00} for them to write a letter to Loan Care in my desperate effort to get my account corrected. Loan Care has not complied to follow the Federal Mortgage Servicing Rules and have not promptly credited my payments to my account for almost 1 year now. Loan Care has VIOLATED THE MORTGAGE DEED AND TRUST. Now that they have returned to me my most recent payment due XX/XX/XXXX I don't know if I am to mail the payment due XX/XX/XXXX and I am afraid to continue to trust that this matter is ever going to get corrected and that they plan to foreclose on my house. In Georgia they don't have a court hearing to foreclose on your home, they can do so after reporting that a person is 3 months delinquent and I am afraid that Loan Care is attempting to take my house.

4388,2020-04-23,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"In XXXX of this year I contacted Capital One and asked a customer service representative how I should go about requesting a good will adjustment of 4 late payments from 2017, when I was having financial hardship due to losing one of my jobs. I was directed to mail a letter to their credit department with that request. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent said letter explaining my circumstances at the time and highlighting that my account has been in good standing since then and asking for the consideration of removing those late payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter telling me that a good will adjustment would not be granted, and that they had placed a "" disagreement code with a resolution of dispute '' on my account. I immediately contacted Capital One asking for an explanation of why, as I had not at all disputed the late payments, asked what the disagreement code meant, and requested it be removed.I was left on hold for long periods of time and spoke to several people who told me they could not explain what it meant. When I was able to elevate the call to a supervisor I was told that I could not speak to anyone in the credit department, they would not remove the remark from my report, and that I should instead contact the credit bureaus for an explanation of what they themselves had placed on my report. I found this to be unacceptable. In my attempt to improve my credit, which has been steadily improving, my lender was taking actions that could potentially set back all of the progress I have made in the past three years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped by XXXX points with no explanation. XXXX - the credit reporting service offered by Capital One gave me a list of "" possible '' reasons my score dropped - none of them applied to my situation. I had not opened or closed an account, and my balances were steadily decreasing as my available credit increased. There was no evident reason my score would drop at all, and it had been steady at XXXX for a couple of months. I immediately logged into all three of the credit bureaus and checked my credit report - there were no changes. I then contacted XXXX via email - in the same fashion as my phone call, I was given a general list of reasons as to why the change would have happened. I responded with detailed responses to each showing that they did not apply to me. I was told that someone would call me to discuss my situation. 

I am working from home and homeschooling my son during the pandemic, so I am not always available to take calls, even in the time I expect to be able to. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX after missing two calls I called back the number that was left. When I finally got someone on the line and explained my situation, I was again told I could not be helped and should contact the credit bureaus to get an explanation of what THEY ( Capital One ) had placed on my report. 

Today on XX/XX/XXXX, after several missed calls from Capital One and failed attempts at getting someone on the line who could help me when I called them back, I contacted TransUnion XXXX the bureau from which XXXX gathers its information ). It took approximately 3 hours and 3 representative before I was able to get the answer that the disagreement code that was placed on my account was the reason for my lowered score. Just as I had suspected, CapitalOne had taken an ( incorrect ) action that had adversely affected my credit score and then refused to help me and rectify the situation. XXXX  was able to remove the remark, but I was told CapitalOne could place it back on my report. 

Since my score dropped XXXX points on XX/XX/XXXX it has risen again by XXXX points because I have continued paying off my balances and making timely payments however that progress is bittersweet because my score is still almost XXXX points lower than I have worked so hard to get it to, and through no negligence of my own. I would like those XXXX points added back to my score as I did nothing to have them removed. 

The poor customer service that CapitalOne provides and their general unwillingness to assist credit holders is astonishing and disappointing. If it weren't for it being one of my longest held accounts I would surely cancel my card with them.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,NY,10463.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-04-23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3618850

I immediately called FedLoan Servicing and asked why this was even happening as they set my payments based on an income contingent repayment plan as part of PSLF program. No one could answer my question other than this was how much outstanding interest was on my account. I was never warned this could or would happen. But, I digress. 
I bit the bullet and paid the full amount on XX/XX/2019. There was no way I was going to let them capitalize an amount larger than what I had paid off over the last 2 years! The payment posted to my account on XX/XX/2019. However, XX/XX/2019, {$260.00} of interest was capitalized. I saw this shortly thereafter when checking my online balance and called immediately. First person I spoke to didn't understand anything so I was forwarded to a "" supervisor. '' My question was simple. Why did ANY interest get capitalized if I paid the EXACT amount that was stated on the notice and well in advance of the due date? After much back and forth, she agreed with me that it was an error and said that the capitalization would be reversed. 
Fast forward to today ( XX/XX/2019 ), I was reviewing my online account again and noticed the interest capitalization was never reversed. In fact, since XXXX it has been considered part of my principal balance and has accrued additional interest! I called again ( this is not to mention multiple other calls to them in the interim about other issues - in which every time I got a different answer and most often the incorrect answer ). After a 30 minute call, the young lady told me she would request a review of my issue. Request a review? I have already been told the {$260.00} interest capitalization would be reversed and now I need all erroneous interest charges on that {$260.00} to be reversed too. She said she could just submit it for review and "" I could call back and follow up. '' What kind of service is this?! It's a scam! First, they most likely thought I wouldn't catch the capitalization. Second, after telling me it would be reversed on a RECORDED phone call, it was not. Rather, it's compounded additional interest on my account. And now, I need to follow up in the next 7-20 business days to see what happens??? I have a FULL TIME job and can't afford to be calling and waiting on hold for some incompetent person to tell me something incorrect. And this is not the first or only issue I've had with these people. I don't have time to elaborate on all the other horrible practices in which they engage.

So my funds are currently inaccessible, even though they are sitting in a wallet controlled by coinbase. 

I have filed many support tickets about this and they simply give me these automated responses saying "" make sure you check that we support the crpyto that you are sending ''.

They hold the keys to the wallet that my {$27000.00} of XXXX is sitting in, NOT me. 

If you have the keys to a wallet with an XXXX token in it ( both XXXX and XXXX ) are XXXX tokens, then you CAN reverse this transaction. Many other exchanges do this for their customers, often for a fee, which would be fine with me. They are simply unwilling to do this. Maybe because the scale of their company that they get so many requests like this that it is not worth their time? I am not sure. But they have {$27000.00} of mine and are refusing to return it or even attempt to support me in anyway. I have done many searches on the internet about this and there are many people in the same situation as me. 

I believe coinbase has an obligation to their customers offer a service to reverse these unsupported crypto transactions. People make simple mistakes misclick a currency all the time, and to just expect that these people need to accept the lose of 5+ figure transactions is not OK. The fact is they CAN assist with this, they just won't for whatever reason. They must be sitting on millions and millions of "" unsupported cryptos '' which they have the power to reverse. 

Please support me in this endeavor. I doubt my message alone will be enough to give them the kick in the XXXX they need, but I hope that with enough pressure they will realize they need to take action on this matter.

4560,2019-06-29,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by Premier Student Loan Center about my government loans. I was informed that they helped students see if they are eligible for student loan forgiveness. After speaking with them and going through some questions, I was told that I was eligible for a student loan forgiveness program and would receive a total of approximately {$32000.00} of forgiveness on this program. This program was an earned program, where I would make a minimal payment monthly, & at the end, the rest of my loan would be forgiven. The company asked for a payment of {$200.00} for the first 6 months, which would pay for them assisting me & being a third party for me to receive this forgiveness program. After those 6 months, I would pay a {$40.00} payment each month which would go towards my forgiveness program on my loan. They then created a FSA Federal Student Aid login for me & had complete access to account as well as my XXXX information. They also had me sign Federal Student Loan Forgiveness Documents. They then sent me a copy of my current federal loans, a congratulations email, & asked for referrals and also offered a {$25.00} visa to any referrals given. A couple days later, I received an email from my student loan provider, XXXX, that they have received my forbearance request and it is being processed. I thought this seemed odd that it was going into forbearance & didn't say anything about forgiveness, so I contacted the company to make sure everything was fine and they assured me that was how it was going to show on my account & everything was going how it was supposed to. A couple days later, I received an email from FSA that they received my request for an Income Driven Repayment Plan. I thought this was part of the process as well. A couple days passed again, in which I received another email from Navient saying I was approved for forbearance, then another email saying they received my Income Driven Repayment request. All of these requests were done by Premier Student Loans. When I went to go back into my accounts they had changed the passwords, I then I had to contact the company in order to get my login information. Since then, I have been making payments as usual. Recently in XXXX XXXX, they contacted me in regard to my "" annual forgiveness program renewal ''. They requested 2 copies of my most recent pay stub, & /or a copy of my federal tax return. They also noted that "" not sending in these documents can prolong, postpone, or place your recertification on hold. '' I do not recall sending any of these documents, & I then received an email saying that they have reviewed my "" file for accuracy and have submitted my recertification application to the Department of Education. '' I also then received an email from XXXX stating they have received my Income Driven Repayment request. This was all work done by Premier Student Loan center again. A few weeks following I received an email stating that my annual recertification application has been approved by XXXX and my new payment information for the year is listed below : Repayment Program : Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment ( REPAYE ) Monthly Payment Amount : {$0.00} First payment Due Date : XX/XX/XXXX This is the last of contact that I have had with them. My payment of {$40.00} has continued to come out of my account. After seeing the scams on the news, I reached out to XXXX in regards to my forgiveness program, which I am currently not on & no payments have been made on my student loans with the company. Right now, I am on the Income Driven Plan, & not on a forgiveness program. They informed me that this company was scamming me & pointed me in the right directions in order to get this resolved.",,Premier Student Loan Center,WA,98503.0,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-02,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3291664

It is delaying my qualification for loan forgiveness and thus costing me 5 months of extra payments that I should not be responsible for. 

As you may know, the PSLF ( Public Service Loan Forgiveness ) program provides a path to forgiveness of remaining loan balance after 120 payments made while working full time in nonprofit, government or military. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, while working full time in nonprofit, I made full monthly payments towards my Federal Direct Loans. These 5 payments were made while my loans were serviced by a different servicer, XXXX XXXX. The loan was transferred to FedLoan Servicing in XXXX. XXXX XXXX no longer keeps records after this transfer. 

According to FedLoan, these payments do not counted towards the total 120 payments simply because it occurred prior to the transfer and they have yet to verify. I disagree as these payments were made with all stipulations of the program satisfied. They should be counted towards my total of 120. 

Over one year ago, I called to request a manual recount. The recount has not been completed. I called FedLoan Ombudsman today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to get an update and was told there is no estimate time as to when this can be completed. The agent, XXXX XXXX did not provide any assurance that it would be done in a timely manner, or that it would be done at all. She did not offer to transfer me to someone who might be able to help. 
I am down to my last few payments of the 120 total, I do not have much time left to get this done and thus I am requesting your help.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general.

I was erroneously enrolled in XXXX protection when I started my account. The actual charge went unnoticed by me since I have had my card. I received bills electronically and due to my own fault, never noticed it/ This year in XXXX I was going to pay off my CITI card and I contacted CITI for a fee. As I was talking to customer service, I asked about the fee that I suddenly noticed. I was informed that I must have signed up for it. I demanded it be canceled and I asked to be provided proof that I even signed up. They said I must have clicked the option or agreed to it. They put me through to XXXX   and was under the impression that I would receive a reimbursement. 30 days went by and I did not see a credit so I called again. I paid off all my bill in XXXX but what I thought they owed me back - approximately XXXX. They could not locate my request and submitted it again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the first denial from CITI. I was upset and called customer service again 3 - 4 days later. I said that I was cancelling my card and I was then transferred to a supervisor - XXXX. He lead me to believe that again, I would be reimbursed and I asked again for proof that I actually signed up. I also mentioned the letter that I received in XXXX that I was being refunded XXXX in fees due to a settlement with CFPB. I asked for proof it was credited. 30 days later - XX/XX/XXXX, I received a second denial letter. This time I gave very negative feedback and was contacted by another senior account specialist. He said I did receive the credit for XXXX. I told him that CITI behaved in a predatory manner. He basically didn't care and transferred me back to a XXXX member. I wish I had the name and date by my phone deleted the vmail call in an update as well as my notes. The individual was located in KY - I believe his name was XXXX. 

I spoke with XXXX  again the first week of XXXX. I explained that I was a XXXX vet, received XXXX and XXXX compensations. The XXXX representative ( again - I apologize but my phone updated and deleted my notes ) was resubmitting the information a third time because she said I most likely was not even eligible.

XXXX XXXX XXXX I wish I read all the one-star, negative reviews before I opened my account.

( Strike one ) I was about to refinance my home and asked the intake clerk if BB & T waived closing costs for current account holders. She said yes. Later, the loan people laughed at be for believing her and refused to waive the costs. ( Strike 2 ) Calls were also not returned. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! When I called corporate to complain, they dragged their feet. ( Strike 3 ). But, wait, there's more! Corporate decided to close my account and sent the letter to the WRONG address where it was opened ( Revealing my ENTIRE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO A STRANGER! ) Fortunately, the stranger saw the CORRECT address on the actual letter and brought it to me. STILL, THIS IS A MAJOR SECURITY BREACH!!!!! Because it was the weekend, I had little recourse, and had to wait until Monday. when I tried to call the lady who signed the letter, THEY REFUSED TO LET ME SPEAK WITH HER!!!!! After waiting 32 minutes arguing and being put on hold, I hung up, called back, and was connected with XXXX who promised to give me 2 more weeks and call me back about my request for 30 days, XXXX never called back and I emailed corporate with a copy of the wrong address envelope and a substantial fine. The result? More retaliation. They had the branch manager XXXX XXXX, call to harass me to set an appointment to close the account. When I refused, they closed it without telling me! My mortgage payment hadn't cleared and the fraud department is stuck on "" Let me call you, tomorrow ... ) If it wasn't for the hassle of changing accounts I would be thrilled to walk away from Brainless Banking Trash!!!

4680,2019-10-02,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Issue 1 Response : We agree that you made a payment of {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and that your due date was XX/XX/XXXX. However, no payment had been received in XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, the payment received on XX/XX/XXXX needed to be credited toward satisfying the delinquent bill from XX/XX/XXXX. Because the XX/XX/XXXX payment was received more than 15 days after the XX/XX/XXXX due date, it did not count as a PSLF-qualifying payment. Therefore, no qualifying payments were counted for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Response to Issue 1 : My previous loan servicer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is no longer in existence. When I try to login to prove my XX/XX/XXXX payment, the website is defunct. My bank also does not keep payment records from this far back. Its egregious that they wouldnt count the XX/XX/XXXX payment because they say I didnt pay my XXXX. Paying a XX/XX/XXXX bill on time, but saying its late because its the XXXX payment, is unacceptable. If I needed to pay both XXXX and XXXX to qualify for XXXX, they should have billed me that amount. I actually did this on XX/XX/XXXX, at the advice of XXXX XXXX XXXX, and paid {$520.00} ( 2 months worth ). 
Therefore, I request that XX/XX/XXXX be counted and the months worth of EXTRA payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX, at the advice of the loan servicer, be counted for XX/XX/XXXX as I was told. 

Issue 2 Response : Your Direct Consolidation Loan transferred to FedLoan Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX ( with an effective date of XX/XX/XXXX ). The financial history confirms that no payments were received from you in either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, a delinquency existed on the account. To resolve the delinquency after the loan transfer period, FedLoan Servicing applied an Administrative Forbearance to the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. This forbearance status was approved retroactively from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX to cover the past-due bills. As a result, no qualifying payments were counted for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. FedLoan Servicing is unable to address any processing delays that may have occurred prior to its servicing period. 
Response to Issues 2 : XXXX XXXX XXXX transferred to FedLoan Servicing, which was completely outside of my control. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a notice saying my loans would be transferred and my bill would be XXXX until the loan transfer process was complete. FedLoan themselves say that the loans were officially transferred finally on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX placed me in administrative forbearance without any choice on my part, and I had no way of even making XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX payments. Saying that they are unable to address any processing delays in unacceptable for people who are attempting to count every payment possible towards loan forgiveness. This was completely outside my control. 
Therefore, I request to have the ability to make retroactive payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

( Issue 3 Resolved ) Issue 4 Response : On XX/XX/XXXX, you made an online payment of {$390.00}. However, for that month, the monthly installment was only {$350.00}. The payment entirely satisfied the XX/XX/XXXX bill and partially satisfied the XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, only a portion of the monthly installment ( {$320.00} ) remained due to satisfy the XX/XX/XXXX bill. You were notified of this amount, which you paid on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the full monthly installment amount ( {$350.00} ) still needed to be paid in order for the payment to count toward the PSLF program. Therefore, no qualifying payment was counted for XX/XX/XXXX. Regardless of the amount due on the monthly billing statement, please continue to remit the full monthly installment if you wish for it to be counted toward the PSLF program. 
Response to Issues 4 : My bank, XXXX XXXX, made automatic withdrawals ( which I signed up through my fed loan servicing ). FedLoan made a mistake when I called and said that my loan recalculation was off, which was why my payment was actually lower than my previous {$390.00}. Its unbelievable that I would pay exactly what my bill says ( and actually pay MORE the previous month due to the fault of Fedloan ) and get penalized for it. Fedloan should have billed me the correct amount, ESPECIALLY when I had automatic withdrawals FROM Fedloan. 
Therefore, I request that XX/XX/XXXX be overridden, and that I have the ability to pay the small difference it what they say I still owed for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Issue 5 Response : On XX/XX/XXXX, an electronic application was received. You requested the repayment schedule to be changed from the IBR plan to the Revised Pay As You Earn ( REPAYE ) plan. Within eight ( 8 ) business days, on XX/XX/XXXX, the process to remove the account from the IBR plan ( opt-out process ) was initiated. The IBR opt-out process, which was completed in accordance with federal regulations, requires the remittance of a payment under a Standard Repayment plan. If a borrower can not afford the installment under the Standard Repayment plan, then a Reduced Payment Forbearance may be selected. This forbearance option allows a borrower to make a lower payment in order to exit the IBR plan and to change to a different repayment schedule. 
Response to Issue 5 : Taking three months to review someones loan information, especially when they are applying for loan forgiveness, is unacceptable and denies me due process. They even said I made the required {$280.00} reduced payment ) on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Therefore, I request that XX/XX/XXXX be overridden and be counted towards my qualifying loan payments, and that I have the ability to override and pay for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.",,AES/PHEAA,NY,11222.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-02,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3392973

4765,2016-08-13,Prepaid card,Payroll card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I was reviewing my account online and noticed five fraudulent transactions and five attempted fraudulent transactions that were declined on my account. I immediately called US Money XXXX to let them know of the fraudulent transactions on my account. They said they noticed the attempts on my account and they said they froze the account so no more transactions could occur. When I asked them if they froze my account on XXXX XXXX how could seven more transactions occur from XXXX XXXX thru XXXX XXXX. There was silence on the phone and they could not give me an answer. I immediately went back on line to print my account transactions and was not able to. I called back to US Money XXXX to ask how come I did not have access to my account and they said the account was frozen on XXXX XXXX not on XXXX XXXX as the representative told me. At that time, I asked for a replacement card and they told me a replacement card would cost {$40.00}. I asked why and they said that was to expedite the card. I told them to send it regular mail so there would be no extra charge. I also asked at that time if they could send me a dispute form and a complete statement of all of my XXXX transactions. They said they would email it to me within XXXX hours. It took three phone calls and two emails to finally get the dispute forms and I still have not received a complete XXXX statement. I called them back after seven business days to let them know that I have not received a replacement card. The representative told me that the card was returned to them with an incorrect address. I do n't understand how this could occur since I always receive statements and checks from them. She told me that she would resend the card and I should receive it within five to seven days. When the end of XXXX came, I called again to let them know that I still do not have a replacement card and would like a card to get access to my remaining funds. On XXXX XXXX, I called and let them know that I still do not have a replacement card. They received my dispute forms with the police report I filed on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX they sent me a response letter stating that they were unable to assist in the recovery of these funds because they claim that the transactions were made face to face and the card was present. They also said that since I failed to contact customer service until four days after the transactions that my claim was not eligible for reimbursement. I called US Money XXXX again and asked for copies of all of the fraudulent transactions and was told that I would have them in twenty four hours via email. Still as of today, I have not received a replacement card, can not access my funds and I have not been reimbursed the {$220.00} of the fraudulent transactions. They did credit my account {$5.00} in fees on the attempted fraudulent transactions. All of these transactions were not face to face and they were all on line transactions. I tried calling US Money XXXX parent company, Check Into Cash, to see if they could assist me and so far I have had no response. Several things about this do not make sense. They claim all transactions were face to face with card present and as you can see they were internet transactions. I reside in South Carolina and have possession of the card and the fraudulent transactions took place in New York. I do not understand how come they will not send me a replacement card so I can access my funds and do not understand why they will not send me any supporting documents. They seem to want to help me until they ask me if I still work for Check Into Cash. I tell them no and then they get abrupt and cold with me. I worked for Check Into Cash for three years and I do not know why that every time I called them they asked this question "" Do you still work for Check Into Cash ''?

On XX/XX/XXXX I was advised by XXXX that the reservation I attempted to make was no longer available and the hold placed on the funds for said reservation would be released. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to contact CASHAPP to have the amount of {$480.00} released back to me and provided them the case ID from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received correspondence from XXXX advising that they could not use the case ID as a means to release the payment but if I was able to secure an email from XXXX stating the payment was to be released, they would do so immediately. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after spending a few hours on the phone I was able to secure said email from XXXX and sent it over to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX stating that they could not see the transaction and that I needed to screenshot it from my phone for them to see the dollar amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I responded with the screenshot requested showing the amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a response from XXXX stating that they could not use the information I provided to affect the refund and that any issues should be referred to XXXX. I responded pointing out the obvious fact that the information provided was the exact information they stated they needed and at no time did they claim that any of the provided documents ( upon receipt ) would not suffice. Furthermore, despite articulations that the information would not suffice they gave no remedies or instructions on what would suffice. They essentially decided to simply ignore the documentation provided ( that they requested ) and move to deny providing the refund. 

At this point, any financial vehicle with unregulated access to funds should be held accountable when it shows to be operating in poor faith. The question is not only why they do not affect this refund but ; 1 ) where is the money 2 ) who is gaining interests on the capital 3 ) is this money being reported as income to the IRS?

4 ) where is this money being held?

5 ) who enforces standards against predatory financial instruments 6 ) if I do not receive my refund, is that considered a loss and as such can I seek to strike that as income from my income taxes?

7 ) when this type of behavior causes financial hardships, is CASHAPP responsible for any subsequent financial harm caused by their poor stewardship.

9 ) should business such as this be allowed to operate or have access to standardize institutions when this type of behavior in large scale could cause widespread economic harm? 

These are questions that should be asked by not only regulatory agencies but lawmakers as well. In this time of economic hardships, they Gov us a fiduciary responsibility to ensure these type of operations are not allowed to continue and remained unchecked.

4834,2019-08-13,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"On or around XX/XX/2019, I deposited $ 5000+ into a BMO Harris account that had a {$500.00} incentive offer associated with it. At the time I was in the branch office in XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL, there was a concern I had that the incentive offer was based on the wording that the money be deposited the same day as the account was opened. I brought this to the attention of XXXX, the branch manager there, and she assured me that if there was any problem because of that, she would take care of it. I just spoke with her today ( XX/XX/2019 ), more than 6 months after I opened the account, and she is wrongly telling me that I was supposed to do a wire transfer the next day. I told her that is not what her and I agreed on which was a bank to bank transfer. If what she was saying was true ( which is it not ), then she should have contacted me 2 business days later if she did not see the money and told me I was disqualified. However, I am 100 % certain that she knew and agreed to the bank to bank transfer, which can sometimes take 6 to 8 business days, which can amount to as much as 12 calendar days in some cases. 

It appears to me they are trying to look for false excuses to not pay me, even though I was assured I should be fine. I asked at least once for XXXX to give me written confirmation of her word but she never sent it to me, making me think she was trying to "" XXXX me over '' all along. She claims she is trying to escalate it up the chain of command, but the agreement was that SHE would take care of any problems, not the higher ups. She appears to be looking for ways not to pay me the {$500.00} but the agreement was made and I met all of the requirements ( with the exception of the same day deposit but that requirement was verbally waived by XXXX ). 

I am requesting that if they say they told me I had to pay via wire transfer only, that they show written proof of that. If they can not, then they can not prove that is what they told me. My very clear recollection is that I told them I would be doing a bank to bank transfer and have to wait to go through the security procedures for doing that and they agreed. I gave them the example "" Do you expect people to just walk in this bank with {$5000.00} cash in their pocket? That seems unreasonable ''. They agreed to that statement and told me a bank to bank transfer is fine and reasonable. 

They are telling me on the phone that because it took 11 days to deposit the money that it was "" too long '' but they never told me any time limit to do the bank to bank transfer. They mentioned 10 days which is very suspicious because it is 1 day less than what I may have taken. Since I am at the mercy of the bank funding the bank to bank transfer ( and somewhat at the mercy of the receiving bank too ), I should not be penalized for taking 11 days to transfer the money. I remember I had a few challenges to get that transfer to work so it was not simple like just pushing a button. 

BMO Harris should be reprimanded for doing this to me. If they "" knew '' I would not qualify, they should have let me know early so I could have taken my money out and invested in elsewhere. However since I feel I met ALL the requirements, I am holding them to the {$500.00} and if they do not pay, I am prepared to contact the local news and report them to warn other people NOT to bank at BMO Harris and possibly even sue them in small claims court. I had a similar problem with another bank ( XXXX XXXX ) but  I "" fought '' them and they paid. I am prepared to "" fight '' again with this bank that is XXXX me around bigtime.

4839,2019-06-15,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received by email a promotional offer from Bank of America ( attached to this complaint ). The offer states that if I open a Bank of America Advantage bank account by XX/XX/XXXX and set up direct deposits totaling {$4000.00} or more within 90 days of opening the account, Bank of America would deposit a {$300.00} reward in my account within 60 days. There was also some fine print, which I have read and none of which disqualifies me from the offer. 

In response to the offer, I opened and funded a Bank of America Advantage SafeBalance Banking  Account on XX/XX/XXXX, and set up direct deposit. I then received direct deposits of {$3500.00} each into the account on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Combined, these of course exceed the {$4000.00} required to qualify for the promotional offer, so I expected to receive the {$300.00} deposit from Bank of America within 60 days. However, by XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received the {$300.00} deposit. That day, I called the company about the missing deposit and spoke with XXXX from South Carolina, who told me that my inquiry had been escalated to the sales department and they would take up to 30 days to investigate. ( I'm not sure what would take so long, since the promotional email takes only minutes to read, as does verifying that I had met the requirements. ) As of today, 40 days have passed and I have heard nothing more from Bank of America, nor has the {$300.00} been deposited in my account. The company has not held up their end of the deal they advertised. 

My complaint today is about the above, but it's worth mentioning that this is not an isolated incident. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a similar promotional email offer from the company. That offer invited me to open a qualifying account by XX/XX/XXXX, and make two qualifying direct deposits of {$250.00} or more within 90 days of opening the account, after which the company promised to deposit {$100.00} within 60 days. I met all the requirements by XX/XX/XXXX, and yet the company did not deposit the {$100.00} within the promised timeframe. I had to call the company numerous times and even make a physical visit to a branch before the company finally made the deposit they had advertised in the promotional email inXX/XX/XXXX. They were delinquent by more than five months on the timeframe they advertised. ( Note that thisXX/XX/XXXX account does not disqualify me from the XXXX promotion because I closed that account in XXXX and was not a signer or owner of a Bank of America personal checking account between then and XX/XX/XXXX. ) It appears to me that the company 's strategy may be to entice potential customers with promotional offers that they do not intend to honor, and to drag their feet when customers inquire in hopes that the customer will forget about the promise or be too busy to pursue the matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",TX,78705.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3276258

I only had 1 loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX not two - so that caught my attention, as I have had some identity theft concerns. However, my bigger concern was that the status for one showed “Debt Included in Bankruptcy “ which is correct as XXXX XXXX was included in my Chapter XXXX and the other XXXX XXXX XXXX account shows “ Charged Off “ with a first report date of XX/XX/XXXX. That’s 3 years after I filed for bankruptcy .. so I called both Experian and XXXX ( who more then a month later has yet to even acknowledge my dispute or sent me the credit report I requested over the phone.) Experian however filed a dispute sent me a copy of the results which now shows that disputed XXXX XXXX XXXX account was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX which is still after I filed for my bankruptcy in which XXXX XXXX was included as well as egregiously different then the date initially listed on my credit report ..

I believe my balance before this problem with them started was around $ 950.which I usually pay it online. However, that time they change the payment and started charging debit cards use so I called them ( XX/XX/2019 ) and see how can I way without paying extra. A representative named XXXX XXXX spoke to me and I thought she can help me with my problem. She told me that theres no way I can pay my balance without paying the transaction fee from the card unless I use check. Which needs to have routing number and account number but it will take 10 business days to clear it up. Since I forgot that they never charge for late fee I told her that okay for now Ill pay with my debit and pay that transaction fee but after she ran my card without confirming that she will run it. Thats where I remember that I dont get charge for late fees. So I told her I change my mind but since she processed the payment already let it go. Then I told her that I will go online instead to do the automatic payment. She told me it will not work and I have to do the process with her and she keep insisting to call me the following month. Even though I told her no but she still keep Insisting and I end up telling okay whatever. That same day I fill up online to do the automatic payment and it went through. I was expecting she will call me a month after as what she told me.but instead, she called me the beginning of the month of XXXX and keeps on calling me Leaving me a message. Some of them has an actually message and some has nothing or she will be singing and leave a message and continue singing/humming. One day, I accidentally answered her call and call me out as if I am not going to pay them ( which I already did ) shes already giving me an attitude and harassing me so I told her that I am not going to talk to her and I want to speak to her supervisor. After the back and fort argument she finally give it to her supervisor name XXXX XXXX ( I  think ) and he was trying to resolve the problem with me and found out that I did made the payment already so tried offering me some discount with the balance and try to make the payment split in 2 payment. However, I told him that I cant afford to make just 2 sets of payments but I am still willing to pay the monthly with the same amount or a little but more. As long as no one will contact or harass me especially That XXXX XXXX and he told that he will talk to her. Then then today, I received an email from her. Telling me that she will send a negative in my credit report if I dont pay my balance which I have been paying as what I told her supervisor. Now, I have been trying to call them and since I am in different place right now I am having a hard time calling them. I just want to make that she will not harass anyone anymore and threatened them about their credit report.",,"Williams & Fudge, Inc",CA,93033.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3464789

Secondly I have also tried to qualify for hardship or get my private student loans lowered and they have not offered any alternatives. My payments continue to go up because I did not realize I signed up for a variable interest rate program. Both my interest rate continue to rise one is at 11.750 % interest rate and my second one is at 10.50 %. I have the money debited out of my account every month to qualify for the .25 % saving but my principal account balance has not gone down. With my XXXX XXXX now coming up for payment I can no longer afford these ridiculous high payments. and on one of my loans show that it has been sold and it looks like they have added more interest onto the principle on XX/XX/2018 of {$150.00} with a principle of {$22.00} which totaled {$22000.00}.

4944,2020-03-02,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"I received my American Express card in XXXX. The available credit was for {$10000.00}. After using it for just a few months they increased my limit to XXXX. In XXXX I had the balance on that card up to almost the full limit. A few months later I made a large payment bringing the balance down to about 40 %. Nothing changed on my account. 
By the summer of XXXX I was suddenly informed that my credit limit was cut down to XXXX, leaving me only a mere XXXX in available credit. 
I appealed that decision and my appeal was denied. 
After this occurred I paid off the card and limited my transactions on it. 
KEEP IN MIND : I NEVER missed a payment nor made a late payment. Not one in all the time Ive had the card. 
Ive always paid more than the minimum, but none of that was considered in their decision. 
Now fast forward to today. Just 6 months later, they have cut my limit AGAIN. Bringing my available credit from {$8300.00} to only {$1000.00}. 
They cut my limit by {$4700.00} the first time and now theyve cut it by another {$7300.00}. 
In only a 6 month period they took away {$12000.00} in available credit. 
My credit score took a huge hit the first time this happened and Im sure will take an even bigger hit this time since it hasnt even recovered from the last decrease. 
When youre in a situation like this your back is against the wall. You are totally at the mercy of the creditor. And that is unfathomably unfair. No one can help you and AMEX does not care about the type of custumer YOU have been to them. 
There is no loyalty to their customers. I did everything right and I was still put in this position. 
I paid on time, paid more than the minimum, and maintained a low balance on the card. 
NONE of that was taken into consideration when making this decision. They went solely based on the other activity on my credit report which should be considered only SECONDARY to the way Ive maintained business with them. That is not the case. 
The appeal process is all you have and all they want to see is proof of income. Something that WASNT even required when opening the account! 
So anything on my credit report that resulted in their decision to decrease my balance then becomes irrelevant if my income is enough?! Thats a very backwards philosophy. 
What AMEX does NOT consider when making these decisions is the affect it has on the overall credit utilization of the consumer and how decreasing the available credit by that much, that quickly, is catastrophic to a consumers credit report. 
Decisions like this should be thoroughly considered and CAREFULLY looked into before they occur. 
I had no drastic changes in my credit report, my income has not changed and even if my utilization was higher than normal, all of my accounts are current and paid on time. Those should be the biggest factors considered when deciding to decrease a consumers available credit. 
Cutting a consumers credit limit by {$12000.00} in less than a year is unacceptable. And for that I am extremely disappointed with the way American Express has decided to conduct business with their customers.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,FL,34743.0,,Consent provided,Web,2020-03-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3551378

My husband and I have been working with Bayview Home Loans since XXXX, attempting to negotiate a Forbearance Plan. We submitted a complete request package on XX/XX/XXXX and shortly thereafter were notified, via mail, by XXXX XXXX that there is a pending hearing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Not only does Bayview have no record of REQUESTING this hearing, they have no record on file of the hearing date scheduled or of giving XXXX XXXX permission to schedule it. We've spoken to Bayview on three separate times regarding this matter - XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. On each of those conversations, Bayview Home Loans confirmed for us that there was NO HEARING SCHEDULED and they had NOT GIVEN permission to XXXX XXXX to do so. 

We're extremely concerned about this situation, given that we can't get a straight answer from either organization and we're asking that you step in and request that this hearing be immediately put on hold. 

Once again, we are actively engaged in negotiations with Bayview Home Loans - given that, under federal guidelines, no legal action can take place until the determination of our request is completed.

4961,2019-10-13,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit repair services,Fraud or scam,,"Weve been in their program for 14 months ( since XX/XX/2018 ), and they have not honored A SINGLE THING present on both our contract with them or the terms of several recorded conversations we had with one of their sales managers, XXXX XXXX, since the day she sold us this atrocious program. 

We had good credit, just a lot of revolving credit card debt. She sold us ( we have the agreements and multiple recorded phone conversations to prove ) AN APPROVED ZERO INTEREST LOAN THAT SHOULDVE AUTOMATICALLY KICKED IN AFTER 12 MONTHS OF MAKING PAYMENTS IN THEIR PROGRAM AND USED TO PAY OUR DEBT IN FULL AND GET OUR CREDIT SCORE BETTER THAN WHEN WE STARTED THE PROGRAM Instead, after 13 months, we were contacted by a 3rd Party Company named Credit 9 who basically told us, ON A RECORDED LINE, that even though those were not the terms of our agreement with Americor, that is all we had available to us.

To add insult to injury, after 6 weeks of back and forth and making us reapply for a supposedly no interest loan we were already approved for ( having agreements and multiple recorded phone calls from different employees means absolutely nothing to these people ), we were finally offered a new loan agreement with the caveat of paying them 22.50 % APR because they did nothing but destroy our name and credit in the last 13 months and now we can not get a proper loan from anyone else. 

Complete scam ( classic bait and switch ) and now we are basically stuck with ruined credit and the option of either paying them this outrageous interest or leave the program in our current state of affairs. 

After a XXXX complaint and multiple reviews left in several different sites, XXXX XXXX from upper management finally decided to properly investigate. After listening to all phone conversations and reviewing all documents, although he did confirm she lied on a recorded line and completely screwed us over, all they were willing to do is fire her ( which they had already done ) and then tell us to either take the 22.5 % loan or leave the program with our credit ruined, obviously him being fully aware that a lawsuit will cost us a lot more then it will them at least until the case was judged. 

Now considering their actions and how they were advertising a zero interest loan ( this week they changed it to 5.99 % ) that is not at all zero or lie interest ( they count the 12 months you make deposits into the program without getting a single penny from them as well as not really being approved for anything as the zero interest period  XXXX sold us ). 

Considering that if you dont take a loan you do not pay any interest anyway and they are advertising and selling customers fraudulent zero/low interest loans, all that was left to do is file a complaint with the FTC and now here, not for their false advertising and extremely fraudulent actions, but all the damage they have caused us, Hopefully we will be able to eventually retain a lawyer who will agree filing a lawsuit against this company of miscreants on a contingency fee basis. 

Once they completely ruin your name and your credit, make you live for 12+ months without any credit cards, finally painting you into a corner where you have no choice but to sign their new loan with exorbitant interest rates, not only it is that much harder for you to pay for good legal representation, it is almost impossible to hold them accountable for their actions ( being the main reasons why they are able to continually pull this scam on people ).",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Americor Funding, Inc",FL,33179.0,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3404054
